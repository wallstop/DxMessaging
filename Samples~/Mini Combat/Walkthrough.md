## Script Overview

Let's understand what each script does:

### Messages.cs

**Purpose**: Defines all message types used in the sample

```csharp
// Message definitions (simplified for explanation)
- VideoSettingsChanged (untargeted)  // Global setting anyone can listen to
- Heal (targeted)                    // Directed at a specific component
- TookDamage (broadcast)             // Announced to all interested parties
```

**Why separate file?** Keeping messages in one place makes them easy to find and prevents circular dependencies.

### Player.cs

**What it does**: Listens for healing messages targeted specifically at this player

**Key code pattern**:

- Registers to receive `Heal` messages **targeted at its Component**
- Only *this specific Player instance* receives the heal
- Other Player instances in the scene won't be affected

**Real-world analogy**: Like having your name called in a doctor's office—only you respond.

### Enemy.cs

**What it does**: Broadcasts when it takes damage

**Key code pattern**:

- Emits `TookDamage` as a **broadcast from its GameObject**
- Any listener interested in damage events will hear it
- The Enemy doesn't need to know who's listening

**Real-world analogy**: Like ringing a bell—anyone nearby can hear it.

### UIOverlay.cs

**What it does**: Monitors game events and updates the UI

**Key code pattern**:

- Listens to `VideoSettingsChanged` (untargeted)
- Listens to `TookDamage` from **all sources** using `RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource`
- Acts as a "dashboard" showing what's happening in the game

**Real-world analogy**: Like a news reporter watching everything and reporting it.

### Boot.cs

**What it does**: Starts the demo by simulating a sequence of events

**Key code pattern**:

- Sends messages to trigger the other scripts
- Acts as a "director" orchestrating the demo

## Complete Message Flow

Here's the full sequence that happens when you press Play:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Boot
    participant UIOverlay
    participant Player
    participant Enemy

    Note over Boot: STEP 1: Boot starts
    Boot->>UIOverlay: VideoSettingsChanged (Untargeted)
    Note over UIOverlay: Rebuilds UI

    Note over Boot: STEP 2: Boot sends Heal
    Boot->>Player: Heal (Targeted)
    Note over Player: Increases HP by heal amount

    Note over Enemy: STEP 3: Enemy broadcasts
    Enemy->>UIOverlay: TookDamage (Broadcast)
    Note over UIOverlay: Shows damage notification
```

---

## Scene 1: Settings Update

### What Happens

Boot sends a `VideoSettingsChanged` message (untargeted).

### Why Untargeted

Settings changes are **global events**—they don't target anyone specifically. Anyone interested in settings can listen.

### The Code Flow

1. **Boot.cs** calls: `MessageHub.Publish(new VideoSettingsChanged())`
1. **UIOverlay.cs** receives it through its registered handler
1. **UIOverlay** rebuilds the UI with new settings

### Developer Notes

#### When to use untargeted messages:

- Global game state changes (settings, game mode, pause state)
- Events that multiple unrelated systems might care about
- Configuration updates

##### Pros:

- Simple and fast
- No need to know who's listening
- Easy to add new listeners

###### Cons:

- No targeting—everyone gets it
- Can't send to just one specific object

---

## Scene 2: Healing the Player

### What Happens

Boot sends a `Heal` message **targeted directly at the Player Component**.

### Why Targeted

We want to heal **one specific player**, not all players in the scene.

### The Code Flow

1. **Boot.cs** finds the Player Component reference
1. **Boot.cs** calls: `MessageHub.Publish(new Heal(amount), targetComponent)`
1. **Only the targeted Player.cs** receives it through its handler
1. **Player** increases its HP

### Developer Notes

#### When to use targeted messages:

- Actions directed at specific objects (heal this player, damage this enemy)
- Commands for specific systems (open this door, activate this switch)
- Any time you need precision delivery

##### Pros:

- Precise delivery to one recipient
- Multiple instances can exist without crosstalk
- Clear intent in code

###### Cons:

- Need a reference to the target
- Can't easily notify multiple targets

---

## Scene 3: Enemy Takes Damage

### What Happens

Enemy broadcasts a `TookDamage` message from its GameObject.

### Why Broadcast

The Enemy doesn't know (or care) who needs to know about the damage. It just announces it.

### The Code Flow

1. **Enemy.cs** detects it took damage
1. **Enemy** calls: `this.EmitBroadcast(new TookDamage(amount))`
1. **UIOverlay** receives it via `RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource`
1. **UIOverlay** displays the damage event

### Developer Notes

#### When to use broadcast messages:

- Events that multiple systems might monitor (damage, death, score)
- Audio triggers (play sound when anything explodes)
- Analytics/logging systems
- UI notifications

##### Pros:

- Publisher doesn't need to know about subscribers
- Easy to add new listeners without modifying emitter
- Great for cross-cutting concerns (audio, VFX, analytics)

###### Cons:

- Less efficient than targeted messages
- Every listener is notified (can't filter by source unless registered specifically)

---

## Understanding Targeting Decisions

### Why Player Uses Component-Targeted Registration

```csharp
// Player.cs registers like this:
token.RegisterComponent<Heal>(this, OnHeal);
```

#### Reasoning:

- Multiple Player instances might exist (multiplayer, AI companions)
- Each Player should only respond to heals directed at **itself**
- Component-level targeting provides this precision

##### What if we used untargeted instead?

- Problem: ALL players would be healed simultaneously
- Not realistic for gameplay
- Hard to control individual player states

### Why UIOverlay Uses Broadcast Without Source

```csharp
// UIOverlay.cs registers like this:
token.RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource<TookDamage>(OnTookDamage);
```

#### Reasoning:

- UI needs to monitor **all damage events** in the game
- Doesn't matter which enemy was damaged
- Acts as a global observer

##### Alternative approaches:

- `RegisterGameObjectBroadcast`: Listen only to broadcasts from specific GameObject
- `RegisterComponentBroadcast`: Listen only to broadcasts from specific Component

###### When to use each:

| Method | Use Case | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource` | Monitor all broadcasts of this type | Combat log showing all damage |
| `RegisterGameObjectBroadcast` | Monitor broadcasts from specific GameObject | Health bar for one enemy |
| `RegisterComponentBroadcast` | Monitor broadcasts from specific Component | Track specific weapon's fire events |

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Diagnostics

1. Select any GameObject with `MessagingComponent`
1. In the Inspector, find the MessagingComponent
1. Check the **"Enable Diagnostics"** box
1. Press Play

#### What you'll see:

- Real-time log of messages sent and received
- Message types and payloads
- Source and target information
- Timing information

### Debugging Checklist

#### Message not received?

- [ ] Is `MessagingComponent` attached to the GameObject?
- [ ] Did you call `MessagingComponent.Create(this)` to get a token?
- [ ] Is the handler method registered correctly?
- [ ] Does the message type match exactly?
- [ ] Is the targeting correct (Component vs GameObject vs Untargeted)?

##### Message received by wrong object?

- [ ] Check if using Broadcast when you meant Targeted
- [ ] Verify Component vs GameObject targeting
- [ ] Check registration method (`RegisterComponent` vs `RegisterGameObject`)

###### Message sent but nothing happens?

- [ ] Verify handler method signature matches
- [ ] Check if GameObject is active
- [ ] Ensure Component is enabled
- [ ] Look for exceptions in Console

## Common Patterns Explained

### Pattern 1: The Observer (UIOverlay)

**What**: A component that listens to many events without being directly involved

**Use for**: UI, analytics, audio, logging

**Key characteristic**: Uses `RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource` to monitor everything

### Pattern 2: The Direct Recipient (Player)

**What**: A component that receives targeted instructions

**Use for**: Entities receiving commands, objects being modified

**Key characteristic**: Uses `RegisterComponent` for precise delivery

### Pattern 3: The Broadcaster (Enemy)

**What**: A component that announces events without knowing who's listening

**Use for**: Events that multiple systems care about

**Key characteristic**: Uses `EmitBroadcast` to send messages

### Pattern 4: The Orchestrator (Boot)

**What**: A component that coordinates by sending multiple messages

**Use for**: Game flow, cutscenes, tutorials, state machines

**Key characteristic**: Publishes various message types to drive the system

## Key Takeaways

### For Beginners

1. **Messages replace direct references**: Instead of `player.Heal()`, use messages
1. **Three targeting types**: Untargeted (everyone), Targeted (someone specific), Broadcast (anyone listening)
1. **MessagingComponent is required**: It manages the lifecycle of your subscriptions
1. **Diagnostics are your friend**: Always enable them when learning

### For Intermediate Developers

1. **Choose targeting carefully**: Match the message type to your use case
1. **Broadcast doesn't mean inefficient**: DxMessaging is highly optimized
1. **Tokens prevent memory leaks**: They auto-unregister when destroyed
1. **Assembly definitions matter**: Configure them correctly for separate assemblies

### For Advanced Developers

1. **Source-filtered broadcasts exist**: Use `RegisterGameObjectBroadcast` for efficiency
1. **Message order can be controlled**: See InterceptorsAndOrdering.md
1. **Performance considerations**: Targeted > Broadcast in terms of overhead
1. **Consider message granularity**: Too many message types = harder maintenance

## What's Next

### Experiment and Extend

Try modifying the sample:

- Add a second Player and see targeted messages in action
- Create a `PlayerDied` broadcast and handle it in multiple places
- Add a UI button that sends messages when clicked
- Implement a damage-over-time system using messages

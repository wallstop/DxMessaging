"""
MkDocs hooks for transforming source code links.

This module provides a hook that transforms markdown links pointing to source files
into full GitHub URLs during the MkDocs build process. This approach keeps markdown
files readable in VSCode preview while generating correct links for GitHub Pages.

Transformations:
- Links starting with Runtime/, Tests/, Editor/, or Samples~/ are transformed
- File links use /blob/master/
- Directory links use /tree/master/
- Spaces in paths are URL-encoded
- Links inside code blocks (fenced or inline) are NOT transformed

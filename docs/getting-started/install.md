## Methods

### OpenUPM (Recommended)

The easiest way to install DxMessaging is via [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.wallstop-studios.dxmessaging/).

If you have the [openupm-cli](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html) installed, run:

```bash
openupm add com.wallstop-studios.dxmessaging
```

#### Benefits of OpenUPM

- Automatic update notifications in Unity Package Manager
- Easy dependency management
- Simple one-command installation
- Version history and changelogs available on the [OpenUPM page](https://openupm.com/packages/com.wallstop-studios.dxmessaging/)

**Don't want to install the CLI?** You can also [add OpenUPM as a scoped registry manually](https://openupm.com/docs/getting-started.html).

### Git URL

- Unity Package Manager > Add package from git URL...
- Paste:

```text
https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/DxMessaging.git
```

- Click Add. Unity imports the package and its analyzers/generators.

### NPM Scoped Registry

1. Open Unity Package Manager
1. Open the Advanced Package Settings
1. Add an entry for a new "Scoped Registry"
   - Name: `NPM`
   - URL: `https://registry.npmjs.org`
   - Scope(s): `com.wallstop-studios.dxmessaging`
1. Resolve the latest `DxMessaging`

Unity will notify you of version updates when using scoped registries.

### From Releases

Check out the latest [Releases](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/DxMessaging/releases) to download the npm `.tgz` package and checksum. Current releases do not include a `.unitypackage` asset.

### From Source

Embed the package under your Unity project's `Packages` directory, preserving
the package manifest and analyzer layout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/DxMessaging.git Packages/com.wallstop-studios.dxmessaging
```

For ZIP downloads, extract the repository contents into
`Packages/com.wallstop-studios.dxmessaging`. Do not copy the package into
`Assets`; that bypasses Unity Package Manager behavior.

### Manual - Manifest.json (not recommended)

- Open your project's `Packages/manifest.json` and add:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.wallstop-studios.dxmessaging": "https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/DxMessaging.git"
  }
}
```

## Minimum Requirements

- Unity 2021.3+ (LTS recommended). See [Compatibility](../reference/compatibility.md) for Unity x Render Pipeline support (Built-In, URP, HDRP).

## After Installation

- In your project, create a GameObject and add `MessagingComponent` to start sending/receiving.
- Optional: enable diagnostics in Editor from the MessagingComponent inspector to see live emissions.

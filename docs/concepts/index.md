This section explains the core concepts behind DxMessaging. **Concepts** are the foundational ideas and mental models that inform how you design and structure your messaging—understanding these will help you make better architectural decisions and avoid common pitfalls.

## Start Here

- **[Mental Model](mental-model.md)** — How to think about DxMessaging. Covers the philosophy, the three message types with analogies, tokens and lifecycle, and when to use what. Read this first.

## Core Concepts

- **[Message Types](message-types.md)** — Deep dive into Untargeted, Targeted, and Broadcast messages with code examples and decision guides.

- **[Targeting and Context](targeting-and-context.md)** — How DxMessaging uses GameObjects and Components as message context, and the role of `InstanceId`.

- **[Listening Patterns](listening-patterns.md)** — All the ways to receive messages: targeted, untargeted, broadcast, and "without targeting/source" patterns.

- **[Interceptors and Ordering](interceptors-and-ordering.md)** — Control message flow with priorities, post-processors, and interceptors.

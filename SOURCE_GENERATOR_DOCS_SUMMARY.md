# Source Generator Documentation - Enhancement Summary

## What Was Missing

The original `Helpers.md` was **too terse** for beginners:
- ❌ Didn't explain what source generators ARE
- ❌ No links to learn more about source generators
- ❌ Assumed prior knowledge
- ❌ Didn't show what gets generated
- ❌ No troubleshooting
- ❌ Limited examples

## What Was Added

### 1. Complete Source Generator Explanation (Helpers.md)

**Added comprehensive introduction:**
- ✅ **Plain English definition**: "Code wizards that write code for you at compile time"
- ✅ **How it works**: You write → Generator sees → Generator creates → You get
- ✅ **Links to learn more**:
  - [Microsoft Docs: Source Generators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview)
  - [Introduction to C# Source Generators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/)

### 2. Detailed Attribute Documentation

#### Message Type Attributes

Each attribute now has:
- Clear purpose ("Tells generator: This is a global message")
- Code example
- **What it generates** section showing the output
- When to use it

**Example:**
```csharp
[DxTargetedMessage]  // ← Tells generator: "This goes to one specific target"
public readonly partial struct Heal { }

// What it generates:
// - Implements ITargetedMessage<Heal>
// - Adds required plumbing for targeted emissions
// - Makes it work with .EmitGameObjectTargeted()
```

#### DxAutoConstructor

- Before/after examples
- Rules (field order, public only, etc.)
- What gets generated (shown explicitly)

#### DxOptionalParameter

- How optional parameters work
- Generated constructor signature
- Usage examples

### 3. Before/After Comparisons

**Manual vs Attribute approach:**
```csharp
// Before (Manual - 20 lines)
public readonly struct Heal : ITargetedMessage<Heal> {
    // ... boilerplate ...
}

// After (Attributes - 9 lines)
[DxTargetedMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct Heal { }

// Result: 55% less code!
```

### 4. Why Use Attributes Section

Clear benefits:
- ✅ 50% less code
- ✅ Fewer bugs (can't forget fields)
- ✅ Cleaner (focus on data)
- ✅ Refactor-safe (auto-updates)

### 5. Common Patterns

**4 patterns with increasing complexity:**
1. Simple message (no data)
2. Message with data
3. Message with optional fields
4. Complex message

Each shows:
- Full code
- Generated constructor signature in comments

### 6. Comprehensive FAQ

**9 common questions answered:**

1. **"Do I HAVE to use attributes?"** → No! Manual works too
2. **"Why `partial`?"** → Explained with file examples
3. **"Can I see generated code?"** → How to view in IDE
4. **"Custom constructor logic?"** → Use manual implementation
5. **"Runtime performance?"** → Zero overhead (compile-time)
6. **"Mix attributes and manual?"** → Yes, across different types
7. **Plus troubleshooting sections**

### 7. Troubleshooting Section

**3 common issues with solutions:**

1. **"Attributes not working"**
   - Checklist (partial, rebuild, Unity version)
   - Fix example (missing partial)

2. **"Constructor not generated"**
   - Cause (no public fields)
   - Fix example

3. **"Unity can't find generated code"**
   - Step-by-step fix (delete Library, reimport)

### 8. Quick Reference Table

| Attribute | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `[DxUntargetedMessage]` | Mark as global | `[DxUntargetedMessage]` |
| `[DxTargetedMessage]` | Mark as targeted | `[DxTargetedMessage]` |
| `[DxBroadcastMessage]` | Mark as broadcast | `[DxBroadcastMessage]` |
| `[DxAutoConstructor]` | Generate constructor | `[DxAutoConstructor]` |
| `[DxOptionalParameter]` | Make param optional | `[DxOptionalParameter] public readonly bool flag;` |

### 9. Visual Guide Integration

**Added to VisualGuide.md:**
- Simple explanation: "Magic markers that tell computer to write code"
- Robot assistant analogy
- What `partial` means in plain English
- Link to full Helpers.md doc

**Example from Visual Guide:**
```
[DxAutoConstructor] → "Hey robot, create a constructor for me"
```

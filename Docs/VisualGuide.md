    style Audio fill:#b7eb8f,stroke:#389e0d,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
```

#### Problems

- ‚ùå Everyone needs to know everyone else
- ‚ùå Hard to add/remove systems
- ‚ùå Memory leaks from forgotten unsubscribes

```

#### Benefits

- ‚úÖ Nobody knows about anyone else
- ‚úÖ Easy to add/remove systems
- ‚úÖ Zero memory leaks (automatic cleanup)

## üì® The Three Message Types (Simple!)

Think of messages like different kinds of mail:

### 1. üì¢ Untargeted (Announcement to Everyone)

Like a megaphone announcement in a stadium - everyone hears it.

```csharp
// Define the announcement
[DxUntargetedMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct GamePaused { }

// Anyone can announce
var msg = new GamePaused();
msg.Emit();

// Anyone can listen
_ = token.RegisterUntargeted<GamePaused>(OnPause);
```

#### Real-world uses

- "Game paused!"
- "Settings changed!"
- "Level loaded!"

### 2. üìÆ Targeted (Letter to One Person)

Like mailing a letter to a specific address - only that recipient gets it.

```csharp
// Define the letter
[DxTargetedMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct Heal { public readonly int amount; }

// Send to specific person
var heal = new Heal(50);
heal.EmitGameObjectTargeted(playerObject);

// Only the player listens
_ = token.RegisterComponentTargeted<Heal>(this, OnHeal);
```

#### Real-world uses

- "Player, heal yourself!"
- "Enemy #3, take damage!"
- "Button, update your text!"

### 3. üì° Broadcast (News from One Source)

Like a news broadcast - comes from one source, anyone can tune in.

```csharp
// Define the news
[DxBroadcastMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct TookDamage { public readonly int amount; }

// Broadcast from enemy
var dmg = new TookDamage(25);
dmg.EmitGameObjectBroadcast(enemyObject);

// UI can listen to specific enemy
_ = token.RegisterGameObjectBroadcast<TookDamage>(enemyObject, OnThisEnemy);

// OR achievement system can listen to ALL enemies
_ = token.RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource<TookDamage>(OnAnyEnemy);
```

#### Real-world uses

- "I (player) took damage!"
- "I (enemy) died!"
- "I (chest) was opened!"

## üîÑ The Message Journey (Step by Step)

When you send a message, here's what happens:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You as Your Code
    participant Msg as Message
    participant Int as Interceptors<br/>(Optional)
    participant H0 as Handler<br/>priority: 0
    participant H5 as Handler<br/>priority: 5
    participant H10 as Handler<br/>priority: 10
    participant PP as Post-Processors<br/>(Optional)

    Note over You: 1. Create message
    You->>Msg: var heal = new Heal(10);

    Note over You,Msg: 2. Emit message
    You->>Msg: heal.EmitGameObjectTargeted(player);

    Note over Int: 3. Validate & Normalize
    Msg->>Int: Check message
    Int->>Int: Is valid? (>0)<br/>Clamp if needed (<999)
    alt Invalid message
        Int--xMsg: ‚ùå Cancel
    else Valid message
        Int->>H0: ‚úÖ Continue
    end

    Note over H0,H10: 4. Execute handlers (by priority)
    H0->>H0: SaveSystem runs first
    H0->>H5: Next priority
    H5->>H5: AudioSystem runs
    H5->>H10: Next priority
    H10->>H10: UISystem runs last

    Note over PP: 5. Analytics & Logging
    H10->>PP: All handlers complete
    PP->>PP: Analytics.Track(...)<br/>Debug.Log(...)
```

### Key points

- **Step 1-2:** You create and emit the message
- **Step 3 (Optional):** Interceptors can validate, modify, or cancel
- **Step 4:** Handlers run in priority order (lower number = earlier)
- **Step 5 (Optional):** Post-processors run after everything (perfect for analytics)

## üéÆ Your First Message (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Define It

```csharp
using DxMessaging.Core.Attributes;

[DxTargetedMessage]     // ‚Üê What kind of message?
[DxAutoConstructor]     // ‚Üê Auto-make a constructor
public readonly partial struct Heal {
    public readonly int amount;
}
```

#### What are those `[DxSomething]` tags?

They're called **attributes** ‚Äî magic markers that tell the computer to write code for you! It's like having a robot assistant:

- **`[DxTargetedMessage]`** ‚Üí "Hey robot, make this a targeted message"
- **`[DxAutoConstructor]`** ‚Üí "Hey robot, create a constructor for me"

The `[DxAutoConstructor]` automatically creates this:

```csharp
public Heal(int amount) { this.amount = amount; }
```

**Why `partial`?** So the robot can add code to your type in a separate file. Think of it as giving permission to extend your struct.

**Want to learn more?** See [Helpers & Source Generation](Helpers.md) for the full explanation!

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Listen for It

```csharp
using DxMessaging.Unity;

public class Player : MessageAwareComponent {
    protected override void RegisterMessageHandlers() {
        base.RegisterMessageHandlers();
        // "When someone sends Heal to ME, call OnHeal"
        _ = Token.RegisterComponentTargeted<Heal>(this, OnHeal);
    }

    void OnHeal(ref Heal msg) {
        health += msg.amount;
        Debug.Log($"Healed {msg.amount}!");
    }
}
```

**Magic:** `MessageAwareComponent` handles all the lifecycle automatically!

- Creates registration in `Awake()`
- Activates in `OnEnable()`
- Deactivates in `OnDisable()`
- Cleans up in `OnDestroy()`

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Send It

```csharp
// From anywhere in your code:
var healMsg = new Heal(50);
healMsg.EmitComponentTargeted(playerComponent);

// That's it! Player will receive it automatically.
```

## üß© Common Patterns Visualized

### Pattern: Scene Transition

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SM as SceneManager
    participant Bus as Message Bus
    participant Audio as AudioSystem
    participant Save as SaveSystem

    Note over SM: Scene is changing
    SM->>Bus: SceneChanged(sceneIndex: 2)

    Note over Bus: Message broadcast to all listeners

    Bus->>Audio: SceneChanged received
    Audio->>Audio: FadeOutMusic()

    Bus->>Save: SceneChanged received
    Save->>Save: SaveGame()

    Note over Audio,Save: ‚úÖ All independent!<br/>No coupling!
```

**Why this works:** AudioSystem and SaveSystem don't know about SceneManager or each other. They just listen for `SceneChanged` messages and react independently.

Code:

```csharp
// Define
[DxUntargetedMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct SceneChanged { public readonly int sceneIndex; }

// Anyone can send
var msg = new SceneChanged(2);
msg.Emit();

// Many can listen independently
_ = audioToken.RegisterUntargeted<SceneChanged>(OnScene);
_ = saveToken.RegisterUntargeted<SceneChanged>(OnScene);
```

### Pattern: Player Input ‚Üí Action

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Input as InputSystem
    participant Bus as Message Bus
    participant Player as Player

    Note over Input: User presses Space
    Input->>Bus: Jump(force: 10f)<br/>[Targeted to Player]

    Bus->>Player: Jump message received
    Player->>Player: ApplyForce()<br/>rb.AddForce(...)

    Note over Input,Player: ‚úÖ Decoupled!<br/>Input doesn't reference Player
```

**Why this works:** InputSystem doesn't need a reference to Player. It just sends a `Jump` message targeted at the player, and the player responds.

Code:

```csharp
// Input system (doesn't know about Player!)
void Update() {
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space)) {
        var jump = new Jump(10f);
        jump.EmitComponentTargeted(playerController);
    }
}

// Player (doesn't know about Input system!)
_ = token.RegisterComponentTargeted<Jump>(this, OnJump);
void OnJump(ref Jump msg) {
    rb.AddForce(Vector3.up * msg.force, ForceMode.Impulse);
}
```

### Pattern: Achievement Tracking

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as Enemy
    participant P as Player
    participant C as Chest
    participant Bus as Message Bus
    participant Ach as Achievement System

    Note over Ach: Listens to ALL messages

    E->>Bus: EnemyKilled
    Bus->>Ach: CheckProgress()<br/>UnlockIfReady()

    P->>Bus: LevelCompleted
    Bus->>Ach: CheckProgress()<br/>UnlockIfReady()

    C->>Bus: ChestOpened
    Bus->>Ach: CheckProgress()<br/>UnlockIfReady()

    Note over Ach: ‚úÖ Sees EVERYTHING<br/>without coupling!
```

**Why this works:** Achievement System uses `RegisterGlobalAcceptAll()` to observe every message type, tracking progress across the entire game without any system knowing about it.

Code:

```csharp
public class AchievementSystem : MessageAwareComponent {
    protected override void RegisterMessageHandlers() {
        base.RegisterMessageHandlers();
        // Listen to EVERYTHING
        _ = Token.RegisterGlobalAcceptAll(
            (ref IUntargetedMessage m) => Check(m),
            (ref InstanceId t, ref ITargetedMessage m) => Check(m),
            (ref InstanceId s, ref IBroadcastMessage m) => Check(m)
        );
    }
}
```

## üö¶ When to Use Which Message Type

### Use Untargeted When

- ‚úÖ Global game state changes (pause, settings, scene load)
- ‚úÖ System-wide announcements
- ‚úÖ Configuration updates

### Use Targeted When

- ‚úÖ Commanding a specific object ("You, do this!")
- ‚úÖ UI updates for specific elements
- ‚úÖ Direct communication (A ‚Üí B)

### Use Broadcast When

- ‚úÖ Events others should know about ("I did this!")
- ‚úÖ Analytics tracking
- ‚úÖ Achievement triggers
- ‚úÖ Notifications from specific sources

## üé® Mental Model: Restaurant Analogy

Think of DxMessaging like a restaurant:

### Untargeted = Restaurant Announcement

> "Attention all customers: We're closing in 10 minutes!"
>
> ‚Üí Everyone hears it

### Targeted = Waiter Delivering Food

> "Order for table 5: Here's your burger"
>
> ‚Üí Only table 5 gets it

### Broadcast = Customer Calling Waiter

> "Excuse me, I need a refill!" (from table 3)
>
> ‚Üí Comes from table 3
>
> ‚Üí Any available waiter can respond
>
> ‚Üí Manager might track it for statistics

## üîç Debugging Visualized

DxMessaging has built-in Inspector support!

### MessagingComponent Inspector

#### Message History (last 10)

- `12:34:05 - Heal ‚Üí Player (50)`
- `12:34:03 - Jump ‚Üí Player`
- `12:34:01 - GamePaused (global)`

##### Registrations

- ‚úì Heal (priority: 0, 5 calls)
- ‚úì Jump (priority: 0, 2 calls)
- ‚úì TookDamage (priority: 10)

## ‚ö° Performance at a Glance

| Metric       | Traditional C# Events | DxMessaging                         |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Speed**    | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° (baseline)   | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° (~10ns slower, negligible) |
| **Memory**   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can leak!          | ‚úÖ Zero leaks (struct messages)     |
| **Coupling** | ‚ùå Tight coupling     | ‚úÖ Zero coupling                    |

**Bottom line:** Slightly slower than raw events, but:

- ‚úÖ Zero memory leaks
- ‚úÖ Zero coupling
- ‚úÖ Full observability
- ‚úÖ Predictable ordering

## üÜò Common Beginner Questions

### "Do I always need MessageAwareComponent?"

**For Unity:** Yes! It's the easiest way. Think of it like `MonoBehaviour` - you inherit from it and it handles all the messy lifecycle stuff automatically.

**For pure C#:** No, you can use `MessageRegistrationToken` directly if you're not in Unity.

**Bottom line:** If you're in Unity, just use `MessageAwareComponent`. It'll save you hours of debugging.

### "Can I send a message to multiple targets?"

**No** - Targeted messages go to ONE specific entity (like mailing a letter to one address).

#### Instead, use

- **Untargeted** if literally everyone should hear it (like a megaphone announcement)
- **Broadcast** if it's from one source and many can observe (like a news broadcast)

##### Example

```csharp
// ‚ùå DON'T: Try to target multiple entities
msg.EmitComponentTargeted(player1);
msg.EmitComponentTargeted(player2);  // Feels wrong, right?

// ‚úÖ DO: Use broadcast so everyone can listen
msg.EmitGameObjectBroadcast(enemy);  // Now anyone can observe this enemy
```

### "What if I forget to unsubscribe?"

**You literally can't forget!** üéâ

When your component is destroyed, DxMessaging automatically cleans up. No `OnDestroy()` needed. No memory leaks possible.

#### Old way (easy to forget)

```csharp
void OnEnable() { GameManager.OnScoreChanged += Update; }
void OnDisable() { GameManager.OnScoreChanged -= Update; }  // Forgot this? LEAK!
```

##### DxMessaging way (impossible to forget)

```csharp
protected override void RegisterMessageHandlers() {
    _ = Token.RegisterUntargeted<ScoreChanged>(Update);
}
// That's it! Automatic cleanup when component dies.
```

### "Is it slower than regular events?"

**Barely** (~10ns per handler = 0.00001 milliseconds).

#### Put it this way

- Regular C# event: ~50ns
- DxMessaging: ~60ns
- The difference: Drinking a coffee takes 3 billion nanoseconds

You get automatic lifecycle, zero leaks, full observability, and predictable ordering for a 20% overhead that's **completely negligible** in any real game.

### "Can I cancel a message?"

#### Yes! That's what interceptors are for

```csharp
// Cancel invalid damage
_ = token.RegisterBroadcastInterceptor<TookDamage>(
    (ref InstanceId source, ref TookDamage msg) => {
        if (msg.amount <= 0) return false;  // Cancel invalid damage
        if (IsInvincible(source)) return false;  // Cancel during invincibility
        return true;  // Allow
    }
);
```

##### Real-world uses

- Block input during cutscenes
- Cancel damage when invincible
- Prevent cheating (clamp values)
- Enforce game rules globally

### "Can I see what messages are firing?"

#### Yes! Open any component in the Inspector and scroll down

You'll see:

- Message history (last 50 messages with timestamps)
- Active registrations (what you're listening to)
- Call counts (how many times each handler ran)

**No more guessing.** You can literally see your event flow in real-time.

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist: Am I Doing It Right

- [ ] Using `MessageAwareComponent` for Unity components? ‚úÖ
- [ ] Defining messages as `readonly struct`? ‚úÖ
- [ ] Using `[DxAutoConstructor]` to avoid boilerplate? ‚úÖ
- [ ] Storing struct in variable before emitting? ‚úÖ
- [ ] Choosing the right message type (Untargeted/Targeted/Broadcast)? ‚úÖ
- [ ] Using GameObject/Component emit helpers? ‚úÖ

If you checked all these, **you're doing it right!** üéâ

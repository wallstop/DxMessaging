## Unity Messaging Frameworks

This section compares DxMessaging with other popular Unity messaging/eventing libraries. Each offers different approaches to solving communication and decoupling problems in Unity.

### Quick Summary: Which Framework to Choose?

#### TL;DR Decision Tree

```text
Need absolute simplest pub/sub setup (zero boilerplate)?
  ‚Üí Use UniRx MessageBroker (publish/receive in 2 lines)

Need complex event stream transformations (debounce, throttle, combine)?
  ‚Üí Use UniRx (reactive programming paradigm)

Already using Dependency Injection (Zenject, VContainer, Reflex)?
  ‚Üí Use MessagePipe (DI-first, best performance) or Zenject Signals (if on Zenject)
  ‚Üí Or DxMessaging (integrates with DI, see Integrations guides for Zenject/VContainer/Reflex)

Need Unity-specific features (GameObject targeting, Inspector debugging, global observers)?
  ‚Üí Use DxMessaging (Unity-first design)

Want plug-and-play with zero dependencies?
  ‚Üí Use DxMessaging (no setup required)

Maximum raw throughput is THE priority?
  ‚Üí Use MessagePipe (highest ops/sec in benchmarks)

Need message validation, interception, or ordered execution?
  ‚Üí Use DxMessaging (interceptor pipeline, priority-based ordering)

Simple pub/sub with automatic lifecycle management and debugging?
  ‚Üí Use DxMessaging (automatic cleanup, priorities, validation, Inspector)
```

##### One-Line Summary for Each

- **DxMessaging:** Unity-first pub/sub with automatic lifecycle, global observers, interceptors, priorities, and Inspector debugging (works standalone OR with DI)
- **UniRx:** Reactive programming with LINQ-style stream operators for complex event transformations
- **MessagePipe:** DI-first, highest throughput for high-frequency messaging in DI architectures
- **Zenject Signals:** Decoupled messaging integrated with Zenject dependency injection

> **üí° Note:** DxMessaging works both standalone (zero dependencies) AND with DI frameworks. See [Integration Guides](../Integrations/) for Zenject, VContainer, and Reflex.

### UniRx (Reactive Extensions for Unity)

**What It Is:** A reactive programming library that treats events as observable streams. Based on .NET Reactive Extensions (Rx), reimplemented for Unity with IL2CPP compatibility.

**Core Philosophy:** Everything is a stream that can be observed, filtered, combined, and transformed using LINQ-style operators.

#### Key Features

- **Stream-based programming:** Transform events into observable sequences
- **LINQ operators:** `Where`, `Select`, `Merge`, `CombineLatest`, `Buffer`, etc.
- **Async operations:** Convert coroutines to observables with cancellation support
- **Multithreading:** Thread-safe operations with main thread synchronization
- **Time operators:** Frame-based and time-based event handling
- **UI integration:** Observable extensions for Unity UI events

#### Code Example

##### Simple MessageBroker Setup (Pub/Sub)

```csharp
using UniRx;
using UnityEngine;

public struct EnemySpawned
{
    public int EnemyId;
    public Vector3 Position;
}

// Publisher - extremely simple, no setup required
public class EnemySpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    void SpawnEnemy(int id)
    {
        MessageBroker.Default.Publish(new EnemySpawned
        {
            EnemyId = id,
            Position = transform.position
        });
    }
}

// Subscriber - also extremely simple
public class AchievementSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        MessageBroker.Default.Receive<EnemySpawned>()
            .Subscribe(msg => Debug.Log($"Enemy {msg.EnemyId} spawned!"))
            .AddTo(this); // Automatic cleanup on destroy
    }
}
```

###### Advanced Stream Transformations (Reactive Programming)

```csharp
// Double-click detection using reactive operators
Observable.EveryUpdate()
    .Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
    .Buffer(Observable.Timer(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250)))
    .Where(xs => xs.Count >= 2)
    .Subscribe(_ => Debug.Log("Double Click!"));

// Combine multiple input streams
var leftClick = Observable.EveryUpdate().Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0));
var rightClick = Observable.EveryUpdate().Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1));
leftClick.Merge(rightClick).Subscribe(_ => Debug.Log("Any click!"));
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ‚úÖ **Complex event streams:** Chain, filter, combine, and transform events elegantly
- ‚úÖ **Async operations:** Better async/await alternative with cancellation
- ‚úÖ **Temporal logic:** Time-based operations (throttle, debounce, sample)
- ‚úÖ **UI reactivity:** Bind UI elements to data streams reactively
- ‚úÖ **Memory management:** Disposable subscriptions prevent leaks

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Simple pub/sub:** MessageBroker handles this well, but using reactive operators for simple scenarios is overkill
- ‚ùå **Execution order control:** No built-in priority system for handler ordering
- ‚ùå **Message validation/interception:** No pre-processing pipeline to validate or transform messages before handlers
- ‚ùå **Unity Inspector debugging:** No Inspector integration to visualize message flow
- ‚ùå **GameObject/Component targeting:** Not designed for Unity-specific targeting patterns
- ‚ùå **Global message observation:** Cannot easily listen to all instances of a message type across different sources

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Allocations:** Can allocate on subscription/disposal; stream operators may allocate
- **Overhead:** Higher than simple events due to observable infrastructure
- **Use case:** Best for complex event transformations; overhead justified by functionality

#### Learning Curve

- **Simple MessageBroker (basic pub/sub):** Very easy - just `Publish()` and `Receive()`, similar to events
- **Advanced stream operators:** Steep - requires understanding reactive programming paradigm
- **Mental model shift:** For complex features, must think in streams, not events
- **Documentation:** Extensive examples, but reactive concepts take time to master
- **Estimated learning time:** 15 minutes for MessageBroker; 1-2 weeks for reactive stream mastery

#### Ease of Understanding

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Very easy) - MessageBroker pub/sub is intuitive and straightforward
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Moderate to difficult) - Advanced reactive operators require learning
- Stream operator code is concise but requires understanding of reactive patterns
- Hard to debug complex observable chains without Rx knowledge
- For advanced features: Team buy-in essential; not intuitive for traditional event-driven developers

#### When UniRx Wins

- ‚úÖ Simple pub/sub with minimal setup (MessageBroker is extremely easy)
- ‚úÖ Complex event transformations (e.g., double-click, gesture detection)
- ‚úÖ Combining multiple input sources
- ‚úÖ Time-based logic (debounce, throttle, sample)
- ‚úÖ UI data binding with reactive updates
- ‚úÖ Teams familiar with reactive programming

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ‚úÖ Need Unity-specific features (GameObject targeting, lifecycle management)
- ‚úÖ Execution order matters (priority-based ordering)
- ‚úÖ Message validation/interception needed (interceptor pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Inspector debugging required (message history, registration view)
- ‚úÖ Direct GameObject/Component targeting
- ‚úÖ Global message observation (listen to all instances of a message type)
- ‚úÖ Late-stage processing (post-processors after all handlers)
- ‚úÖ Automatic lifecycle management (zero memory leaks)
- ‚úÖ Teams unfamiliar with reactive programming (and don't need reactive features)

### MessagePipe (High-Performance Messaging)

**What It Is:** A high-performance, DI-first messaging library by Cysharp (creators of UniTask). Designed for in-memory and distributed messaging with zero-allocation focus.

**Core Philosophy:** Maximum performance with dependency injection integration. Support all messaging patterns with a unified, generic interface.

#### Key Features

- **Multiple patterns:** Pub/Sub, Request/Response, Mediator patterns
- **Sync and async:** Full async/await support with configurable strategies (sequential/parallel)
- **Keyed messaging:** Type-based or key-based message routing
- **DI-first design:** Deep integration with dependency injection containers
- **Filters:** Pre/post execution customization (similar to interceptors)
- **Zero allocation:** Struct messages with zero GC per publish
- **Roslyn analyzer:** Detects subscription leaks at compile-time
- **Global and scoped:** Support for global message bus or scoped instances

#### Code Example

```csharp
// Using MessagePipe with DI
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private IPublisher<EnemySpawned> _publisher;
    private IDisposable _subscription;

    void Start()
    {
        // Injected via DI container
        _publisher = GlobalMessagePipe.GetPublisher<EnemySpawned>();
        var subscriber = GlobalMessagePipe.GetSubscriber<EnemySpawned>();

        _subscription = subscriber.Subscribe(msg =>
        {
            Debug.Log($"Enemy spawned: {msg.EnemyId}");
        });
    }

    void SpawnEnemy(int id)
    {
        _publisher.Publish(new EnemySpawned { EnemyId = id });
    }

    void OnDestroy() => _subscription?.Dispose();
}

// Async handler with filters
public class AchievementSystem
{
    public AchievementSystem(IAsyncSubscriber<EnemyKilled> subscriber)
    {
        subscriber.Subscribe(async (msg, cancellationToken) =>
        {
            await SaveAchievementAsync(msg.EnemyType);
        });
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ‚úÖ **Performance:** 78x faster than Prism EventAggregator, zero allocations
- ‚úÖ **DI integration:** First-class support for dependency injection
- ‚úÖ **Async messaging:** Native async/await without blocking
- ‚úÖ **Leak detection:** Analyzer catches forgotten subscriptions at compile-time
- ‚úÖ **Flexibility:** Keyed, keyless, buffered, request/response patterns
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform:** Works in Unity, .NET, Blazor, etc.

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ‚ùå **Unity-specific integration:** No built-in Unity MonoBehaviour lifecycle management or GameObject targeting
- ‚ùå **Inspector debugging:** No visual debugging or message history in Unity Inspector
- ‚ùå **Execution order control:** No priority system (handlers execute in subscription order)
- ‚ùå **Setup complexity:** Requires DI container configuration (VContainer/Zenject setup needed)
- ‚ùå **Global message observation:** No built-in way to listen to all instances of a message across different keys/sources
- ‚ùå **Standalone use:** Designed for DI-first architecture (less suitable for non-DI projects)

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Best-in-class:** Claims 78x faster than Prism, faster than C# events in some scenarios
- **Zero allocation:** Struct-based messages with no GC per publish
- **Benchmark data:** See performance section above for actual numbers
- **Use case:** Optimized for high-frequency messaging (thousands/frame)

#### Learning Curve

- **Moderate:** Requires understanding of dependency injection
- **DI knowledge:** Must be comfortable with service provider pattern
- **Generic interfaces:** Multiple generic types can be confusing initially
- **Estimated learning time:** 2-3 days with DI experience; 1 week without

#### Ease of Understanding

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Moderate)
- Clean, generic interfaces once you understand DI
- Code is straightforward for developers familiar with DI patterns
- Harder for teams without DI experience

#### When MessagePipe Wins

- ‚úÖ Performance-critical applications (high message throughput)

- ‚úÖ Cross-platform .NET projects (not Unity-only)
- ‚úÖ Need async messaging with cancellation
- ‚úÖ Large-scale projects with DI architecture
- ‚úÖ Teams experienced with DI patterns

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ‚úÖ Unity-first projects (not cross-platform .NET)
- ‚úÖ Unity lifecycle management needed (automatic MonoBehaviour cleanup)
- ‚úÖ Inspector debugging essential (message history visualization)
- ‚úÖ Execution order control needed (priority-based handlers)
- ‚úÖ Message validation/interception required (interceptor pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Global message observation needed (listen to all message instances)
- ‚úÖ Post-processing stage needed (analytics, logging after handlers)
- ‚úÖ Teams without DI experience or projects not using DI
- ‚úÖ Plug-and-play simplicity preferred over DI configuration

| **Leak Detection**       | ‚úÖ Roslyn analyzer          | ‚úÖ Automatic lifecycle   |

**Bottom Line:** MessagePipe is the performance king with DI-first design. DxMessaging is Unity-first with lifecycle awareness and debugging. Use MessagePipe if you have DI infrastructure and need maximum performance. Use DxMessaging if you want Unity-native messaging with automatic lifecycle management.

> **üí° Want both?** DxMessaging integrates with DI frameworks! See [DI Integration Guides](../Integrations/) for Zenject, VContainer, and Reflex. Use DI for service construction, DxMessaging for event communication.

### Zenject Signals (DI-Based Messaging)

**What It Is:** The built-in messaging system for Zenject (Extenject), a dependency injection framework for Unity. Signals are an optional extension that provides decoupled communication.

**Core Philosophy:** Loosely coupled messaging integrated with dependency injection. Reduce direct dependencies between classes while maintaining testability.

#### Key Features

- **DI-integrated:** Signals declared and resolved via Zenject container
- **Typed signals:** Strongly-typed signal classes with parameters
- **Synchronous and async:** Sync (RunSync) and async (RunAsync) execution modes
- **Subscription modes:** Require, optional, or optional-with-warning subscribers
- **Installer-based setup:** Declare signals in installers for container binding
- **Multiple subscription methods:** Direct binding, SignalBus subscription, stream-based (with UniRx)
- **Testable:** Easy to mock and test with dependency injection

#### Code Example

```csharp
// 1. Define signal
public class EnemyKilledSignal
{
    public string EnemyType;
    public int Score;
}

// 2. Install and declare in installer
public class GameInstaller : MonoInstaller
{
    public override void InstallBindings()
    {
        SignalBusInstaller.Install(Container);
        Container.DeclareSignal<EnemyKilledSignal>();
        Container.BindSignal<EnemyKilledSignal>()
            .ToMethod<AchievementSystem>(x => x.OnEnemyKilled)
            .FromResolve();
    }
}

// 3. Fire signal
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Inject] private SignalBus _signalBus;

    void Die()
    {
        _signalBus.Fire(new EnemyKilledSignal
        {
            EnemyType = "Orc",
            Score = 100
        });
    }
}

// 4. Subscribe to signal
public class AchievementSystem
{
    [Inject] private SignalBus _signalBus;

    public void Initialize()
    {
        _signalBus.Subscribe<EnemyKilledSignal>(OnEnemyKilled);
    }

    void OnEnemyKilled(EnemyKilledSignal signal)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Killed {signal.EnemyType} for {signal.Score} points!");
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ‚úÖ **Decoupling:** Classes communicate without direct references
- ‚úÖ **DI integration:** Seamless with Zenject dependency injection
- ‚úÖ **Testability:** Easy to mock SignalBus in tests
- ‚úÖ **Type safety:** Strongly-typed signal classes
- ‚úÖ **Subscriber validation:** Can enforce required subscribers
- ‚úÖ **Async support:** Fire signals synchronously or asynchronously

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ‚ùå **Zenject dependency:** Must use Zenject/Extenject framework; not standalone
- ‚ùå **Performance overhead:** Higher than lightweight messaging (DI resolution cost)
- ‚ùå **Execution order control:** No priority system for handler ordering
- ‚ùå **Inspector debugging:** No visual message history or flow visualization
- ‚ùå **Allocations:** Signal parameters can cause allocations depending on usage
- ‚ùå **Validation pipeline:** No built-in interceptor or pre-processing stage
- ‚ùå **Global observation:** Cannot easily listen to all signal fires across the system
- ‚ùå **Post-processing:** No dedicated after-handler stage for analytics/logging

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Overhead:** Higher than lightweight messaging (DI resolution + boxing)
- **Allocations:** Signal parameters can cause allocations (depends on implementation)
- **Benchmark data:** See performance section above for actual numbers
- **Use case:** Performance trade-off for testability and DI benefits

#### Learning Curve

- **Moderate to steep:** Requires understanding Zenject dependency injection
- **Zenject knowledge:** Must learn Zenject before signals
- **Setup overhead:** Installers, bindings, container configuration
- **Estimated learning time:** 1 week for Zenject + signals together

#### Ease of Understanding

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Moderate)
- Clear once you understand Zenject
- Signal concept is straightforward
- Setup (installers, bindings) adds complexity

#### When Zenject Signals Win

- ‚úÖ Already using Zenject for dependency injection
- ‚úÖ Testability is critical (DI makes mocking easy)
- ‚úÖ Need subscriber validation (ensure handlers exist)
- ‚úÖ Team experienced with Zenject
- ‚úÖ Want DI-managed lifecycle

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ‚úÖ Not using Zenject/Extenject (or prefer standalone solution)
- ‚úÖ Performance critical (lower overhead than DI-based signals)
- ‚úÖ Execution order control needed (priority-based handlers)
- ‚úÖ Inspector debugging required (message history visualization)
- ‚úÖ Message validation/interception needed (interceptor pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Global message observation needed (listen to all signal fires)
- ‚úÖ Post-processing stage needed (analytics after handlers)
- ‚úÖ Zero-allocation messaging essential (struct-based)
- ‚úÖ GameObject/Component targeting needed (Unity-specific patterns)
- ‚úÖ Plug-and-play simplicity preferred over DI setup

## Scriptable Object Architecture (SOA)

**What It Is:** A Unity-specific pattern popularized by Ryan Hipple's [Unite 2017 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk) that uses ScriptableObject assets for runtime communication (GameEvent, FloatVariable, etc.).

**Core Philosophy:** Designer-driven, asset-based communication where systems communicate through serialized SO assets instead of direct references.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Controversial Pattern:** SOA has significant criticisms regarding scalability and maintainability. See [Anti-ScriptableObject Architecture](https://github.com/cathei/AntiScriptableObjectArchitecture) for detailed critique. Unity recommends ScriptableObjects for **immutable design data**, not mutable runtime state.

### Quick Comparison

| Aspect               | SOA (GameEvent/Variables)                                                 | DxMessaging                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Designer Control** | ‚úÖ High (create events in Inspector)                                      | ‚ùå Low (code-driven)                |
| **Type Safety**      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed (SO refs typed, but UnityEvent wiring loses compile-time safety) | ‚úÖ Strong (compile-time validation) |
| **Lifecycle**        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual (assets persist)                                                | ‚úÖ Automatic (tokens clean up)      |
| **Performance**      | ‚ö†Ô∏è List iteration, UnityAction overhead                                   | ‚úÖ Zero-allocation structs          |
| **Testability**      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires SO asset cleanup                                              | ‚úÖ Isolated buses per test          |

### When to Use Each

#### Choose SOA when

- Designers need to create and wire events in the Inspector without code
- Your team is already deeply invested in SOA with existing assets
- Designer empowerment is more important than code maintainability

##### Choose DxMessaging when

- You need type-safe, code-driven messaging
- Performance and zero-allocation are priorities
- You want automatic lifecycle management
- You need interceptors, priorities, or global observers

###### Use Both when

- ScriptableObjects for **immutable config data** (weapon stats, level configs)
- DxMessaging for **runtime events and communication**
- This is the recommended approach - use each tool correctly

## Traditional Approaches

### Standard C# Events/Actions

**What It Is:** C#'s built-in event and delegate system. The default way to handle callbacks and notifications in .NET and Unity.

**Core Philosophy:** Direct, type-safe callbacks between objects. Simple, familiar, and built into the language.

#### Key Features

- **Language-native:** Built into C#, no dependencies
- **Type-safe:** Compile-time checking of event signatures
- **Return values:** Events can return values and use `out` parameters
- **Inline lambdas:** Subscribe with anonymous functions
- **Multicast:** Multiple subscribers per event
- **Fast:** Direct method invocation with minimal overhead

#### Code Example

```csharp
// Define and use C# events
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public event Action<int> OnScoreChanged;

    public void AddScore(int points)
    {
        OnScoreChanged?.Invoke(points);
    }
}

public class UI : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameManager gameManager;

    void OnEnable()
    {
        gameManager.OnScoreChanged += UpdateScore;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        gameManager.OnScoreChanged -= UpdateScore;
    }

    void UpdateScore(int points)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Score: {points}");
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ‚úÖ **Simple callbacks:** Straightforward notification pattern
- ‚úÖ **Type safety:** Compile-time checking prevents errors
- ‚úÖ **Return values:** Can get feedback from event handlers
- ‚úÖ **Performance:** Minimal overhead, direct invocation
- ‚úÖ **Familiarity:** Every C# developer knows events
- ‚úÖ **No dependencies:** Built into the language

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ‚ùå **Memory leaks:** Forgetting to unsubscribe causes leaks
- ‚ùå **Tight coupling:** Subscribers need direct references to event sources
- ‚ùå **Execution order:** Undefined handler invocation order
- ‚ùå **Lifecycle management:** Manual subscribe/unsubscribe in OnEnable/OnDisable
- ‚ùå **Debugging:** No visibility into who's subscribed or when events fire
- ‚ùå **Validation/interception:** No pipeline to modify or validate before handlers
- ‚ùå **Global observation:** Cannot listen to all events across the system

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Fastest option:** Direct method invocation (~50ns per call)
- **Zero allocation:** No GC pressure for basic events
- **Inline-able:** JIT can optimize simple event calls
- **Use case:** Best raw performance for simple notifications

#### Learning Curve

- **Zero for C# developers:** Standard language feature
- **Immediate productivity:** No new concepts to learn
- **Estimated learning time:** Already know it

#### Ease of Understanding

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Very easy)
- Familiar to all C# developers
- Straightforward mental model
- Easy to debug with breakpoints

#### When C# Events Win

- ‚úÖ Small, stable scope (5-10 events max)
- ‚úÖ Need return values or `out` parameters
- ‚úÖ Writing a library (DxMessaging is Unity-specific)
- ‚úÖ Simple, local communication within a class or module
- ‚úÖ Team is C# experts, Unity beginners
- ‚úÖ Performance is absolutely critical (lowest overhead)
- ‚úÖ Quick prototypes or game jams

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ‚úÖ Memory leaks are a problem (automatic lifecycle management)
- ‚úÖ Need decoupling (systems don't reference each other)
- ‚úÖ Execution order matters (priority-based handlers)
- ‚úÖ Debugging "what fired when" (Inspector message history)
- ‚úÖ Message validation/interception needed (interceptor pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Global observation needed (listen to all message instances)
- ‚úÖ Cross-system communication (10+ systems)
- ‚úÖ Long-term maintenance (months/years)
- ‚úÖ GameObject/Component targeting needed
- ‚úÖ Post-processing stage needed (analytics after handlers)

#### Direct Comparison

| Aspect                   | C# Events             | DxMessaging            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Primary Use Case**     | Simple callbacks      | Pub/sub messaging      |

| **Lifecycle Management** | ‚ùå Manual unsubscribe | ‚úÖ Automatic           |
| **Execution Order**      | ‚ùå Undefined          | ‚úÖ Priority-based      |
| **GameObject Targeting** | ‚ùå Not built-in       | ‚úÖ Built-in            |
| **Unity Integration**    | ‚≠ê None               | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Deep        |
| **Inspector Debugging**  | ‚ùå No                 | ‚úÖ History + stats     |
| **Interceptors**         | ‚ùå Not built-in       | ‚úÖ Full pipeline       |
| **Global Observers**     | ‚ùå Not built-in       | ‚úÖ Listen to all       |
| **Post-Processing**      | ‚ùå Not built-in       | ‚úÖ Dedicated stage     |
| **Testability**          | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Hard to isolate  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Local buses |
| **Decoupling**           | ‚≠ê Tight coupling     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent   |
| **Return Values**        | ‚úÖ Yes                | ‚ùå Fire-and-forget     |

**Bottom Line:** C# events are the fastest and simplest for basic callbacks. DxMessaging is better for complex, decoupled systems where lifecycle management, debugging, and execution control matter.

### UnityEvents (Inspector Wiring)

**What It Is:** Unity's serializable event system that allows wiring callbacks in the Inspector. Designed for designer-friendly event hookups without code.

**Core Philosophy:** Visual, Inspector-based event connections. Enable non-programmers to wire game logic through the editor.

#### Key Features

- **Inspector wiring:** Drag-and-drop connections in Unity Inspector
- **Serializable:** Events saved with scenes and prefabs
- **Designer-friendly:** Non-programmers can wire logic
- **Persistent references:** Connections survive across sessions
- **Dynamic parameters:** Pass values from Inspector to callbacks
- **No code required:** Can wire entire behaviors without scripting

#### Code Example

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

public class Button : MonoBehaviour
{
    public UnityEvent onClick;

    void OnMouseDown()
    {
        onClick?.Invoke();
    }
}

public class UI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void ShowMenu()
    {
        Debug.Log("Menu shown");
    }

    public void HideMenu()
    {
        Debug.Log("Menu hidden");
    }
}

// In Inspector: Drag UI component to Button's onClick event
// Select ShowMenu from dropdown
// No additional code needed
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ‚úÖ **Visual wiring:** See connections in Inspector
- ‚úÖ **No code required:** Designers can hook up events
- ‚úÖ **Persistence:** Connections saved with scenes/prefabs
- ‚úÖ **Rapid prototyping:** Quick iteration without scripting
- ‚úÖ **Prefab workflows:** Events work across prefab instances

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ‚ùå **Hidden dependencies:** Connections invisible in code, hard to find during refactoring
- ‚ùå **Brittle at scale:** Renaming methods breaks wiring, no compile-time safety
- ‚ùå **Execution order:** Undefined call order for multiple subscribers
- ‚ùå **No validation:** No way to validate or intercept before invocation
- ‚ùå **Performance:** Slower than C# events due to reflection and boxing
- ‚ùå **Debugging:** Hard to trace "who called what" at runtime
- ‚ùå **Merge conflicts:** Inspector changes cause git conflicts
- ‚ùå **Refactoring pain:** Renaming/moving methods silently breaks connections

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Slow compared to alternatives:** Reflection overhead, boxing for value types
- **Allocations:** Parameters boxed as objects, causes GC pressure
- **Use case:** Acceptable for UI and low-frequency events, avoid for high-frequency gameplay

#### Learning Curve

- **Very easy:** Point-and-click in Inspector
- **No coding knowledge needed:** Accessible to designers
- **Estimated learning time:** 5-10 minutes

#### Ease of Understanding

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easy for wiring, hard for debugging)
- Simple to connect in Inspector
- Difficult to understand flow when reading code
- Hard to track down at scale (where is this method called from?)

#### When UnityEvents Win

- ‚úÖ Designers need to wire logic without code
- ‚úÖ Rapid prototyping with prefabs
- ‚úÖ Very simple games (mobile casual, hyper-casual)
- ‚úÖ UI interactions with minimal logic
- ‚úÖ Small projects (<5 scripts)
- ‚úÖ One-off connections that rarely change

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ‚úÖ Code-first development (programmers prefer code visibility)
- ‚úÖ Refactoring frequently (compile-time safety)
- ‚úÖ Execution order matters (priority-based handlers)
- ‚úÖ Need validation/interception (interceptor pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Performance-sensitive (zero allocation required)
- ‚úÖ Debugging observability (message history)
- ‚úÖ Cross-system communication (10+ components)
- ‚úÖ Team collaboration (merge-friendly code over Inspector)
- ‚úÖ Long-term maintenance (find usages, refactor safely)

| **DI Integration**       | ‚ùå No                  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional            |
| **Async/Await**          | ‚ùå No                  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual              |
| **Type Safety**          | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Weak (serialized) | ‚úÖ Strong              |
| **Lifecycle Management** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Unity-managed       | ‚úÖ Automatic           |
| **Execution Order**      | ‚ùå Undefined           | ‚úÖ Priority-based      |

| **Post-Processing**      | ‚ùå Not built-in        | ‚úÖ Dedicated stage     |
| **Testability**          | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Scene setup       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Local buses |
| **Decoupling**           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Hidden refs       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent   |
| **Refactoring Safety**   | ‚ùå Silent breakage     | ‚úÖ Compile-time errors |
| **Code Visibility**      | ‚ùå Hidden in Inspector | ‚úÖ Explicit in code    |

**Bottom Line:** UnityEvents are great for simple Inspector-based wiring and designer workflows. DxMessaging is better for code-first development, refactoring safety, and complex messaging needs.

### Unity SendMessage

**What It Is:** Unity's legacy reflection-based message system. Calls methods by name on GameObjects and their components.

**Core Philosophy:** String-based, reflection-driven communication. Designed for simplicity and GameObject hierarchy traversal.

#### Key Features

- **String-based:** Call methods by name without references
- **Hierarchy traversal:** SendMessageUpwards, BroadcastMessage for parent/child searching
- **No dependencies:** Built into Unity GameObject
- **Simple API:** One-line method calls
- **GameObject-centric:** Works with Unity's component model
- **Optional receivers:** Methods don't need to exist (SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver)

#### Code Example

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Took {amount} damage");
    }
}

public class Weapon : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Attack(GameObject target)
    {
        // Call TakeDamage on target GameObject
        target.SendMessage("TakeDamage", 10);
    }

    void AttackUpwards()
    {
        // Call on this GameObject and all parents
        SendMessageUpwards("TakeDamage", 5, SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver);
    }

    void AttackChildren()
    {
        // Call on this GameObject and all children
        BroadcastMessage("TakeDamage", 3);
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ‚úÖ **No references needed:** Call methods without GetComponent
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchy traversal:** Easy parent/child communication
- ‚úÖ **Simple API:** One-line method invocation
- ‚úÖ **Optional receivers:** Can call non-existent methods safely
- ‚úÖ **Built-in:** No setup or dependencies

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ‚ùå **No type safety:** String-based, typos cause silent failures
- ‚ùå **Slow performance:** Reflection overhead on every call
- ‚ùå **Limited parameters:** Only 0 or 1 parameter supported
- ‚ùå **Boxing allocations:** Value types boxed to object, causes GC
- ‚ùå **Hard to debug:** No compile-time checking, no IDE "Find Usages"
- ‚ùå **Refactoring nightmare:** Renaming methods breaks string references
- ‚ùå **No validation:** No way to validate or intercept messages
- ‚ùå **Execution order:** Undefined call order for multiple receivers

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Very slow:** Reflection overhead much worse than events or messaging systems
- **Allocations:** Boxing value type parameters causes GC pressure
- **Use case:** Legacy code only; avoid for new development

#### Learning Curve

- **Very easy:** Simple one-line API
- **Immediate productivity:** No setup required
- **Estimated learning time:** 5 minutes

#### Ease of Understanding

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Simple to use, hard to maintain)
- Easy to write initially
- Difficult to track method calls (no Find Usages)
- Refactoring breaks string references silently

#### When Unity SendMessage Wins

- ‚úÖ Legacy code that already uses it
- ‚úÖ Quick prototypes (throwaway code)
- ‚úÖ Simple tutorials or learning examples
- ‚úÖ Calling optional methods that may not exist

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ‚úÖ Type safety required (compile-time checking)
- ‚úÖ Performance matters (zero allocation, no reflection)
- ‚úÖ Multiple parameters needed (struct fields)
- ‚úÖ Refactoring frequently (find usages, rename safely)
- ‚úÖ Debugging observability (message history)
- ‚úÖ Execution order control (priority-based handlers)
- ‚úÖ Message validation/interception (interceptor pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Production code (maintainability over simplicity)
- ‚úÖ Modern projects (avoid legacy patterns)

| **Testability**          | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Requires GameObjects | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Local buses       |
| **Decoupling**           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê String-based         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent         |
| **Refactoring Safety**   | ‚ùå Silent breakage        | ‚úÖ Compile-time errors       |
| **Parameters**           | ‚ö†Ô∏è 0 or 1 only            | ‚úÖ Unlimited (struct fields) |

**Bottom Line:** SendMessage is legacy Unity API. Use only for maintaining old code. DxMessaging provides all the same capabilities with type safety, performance, and modern tooling.

**Migration Path:** DxMessaging provides `ReflexiveMessage` to bridge legacy SendMessage behavior:

```csharp
using DxMessaging.Core;
using DxMessaging.Core.Messages;

// Legacy SendMessage equivalent
InstanceId target = gameObject;
var msg = new ReflexiveMessage("OnHit", ReflexiveSendMode.Upwards, 10);
MessageHandler.MessageBus.TargetedBroadcast(ref target, ref msg);

// Prefer typed messages for new code:
// - Multiple parameters via struct fields
// - By-ref handlers avoid boxing
// - Compile-time safety
```

### Global Event Bus Singletons

**What It Is:** A static/singleton class that centralizes all events in one global location. Common pattern for decoupling without dependency injection.

**Core Philosophy:** Central event hub accessible from anywhere. Simplify communication through a single global entry point.

#### Key Features

- **Global access:** Static class available everywhere
- **No references needed:** No GetComponent or serialized fields
- **Simple pattern:** Easy to understand and implement
- **Decoupling:** Publishers and subscribers don't know about each other
- **Flexibility:** Can add events without changing existing code

#### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

public static class EventHub
{
    public static event Action<int> OnDamage;
    public static event Action<string> OnEnemyKilled;
    public static event Action OnGameOver;

    public static void RaiseDamage(int amount) => OnDamage?.Invoke(amount);
    public static void RaiseEnemyKilled(string enemyType) => OnEnemyKilled?.Invoke(enemyType);
    public static void RaiseGameOver() => OnGameOver?.Invoke();
}

// Producer
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Die()
    {
        EventHub.RaiseEnemyKilled("Orc");
    }
}

// Consumer
public class UI : MonoBehaviour
{
    void OnEnable()
    {
        EventHub.OnEnemyKilled += HandleEnemyKilled;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        EventHub.OnEnemyKilled -= HandleEnemyKilled;
    }

    void HandleEnemyKilled(string enemyType)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Enemy killed: {enemyType}");
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ‚úÖ **Global decoupling:** No direct references between systems
- ‚úÖ **Easy to add events:** Just add to static class
- ‚úÖ **Simple pattern:** Straightforward to implement and understand
- ‚úÖ **No setup:** No DI container or framework needed

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ‚ùå **Memory leaks:** Still manual subscribe/unsubscribe (same as C# events)
- ‚ùå **Global state:** Everything in one bag, hard to organize at scale
- ‚ùå **Execution order:** Undefined handler invocation order
- ‚ùå **Testing difficulty:** Global state makes unit testing hard
- ‚ùå **Naming conflicts:** All events in same namespace, naming gets messy
- ‚ùå **No validation:** No way to intercept or validate messages
- ‚ùå **No observability:** Can't see who's subscribed or message history
- ‚ùå **Ownership unclear:** Who manages what events?
- ‚ùå **Lifecycle management:** Manual subscribe/unsubscribe required

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Good performance:** Similar to C# events (static overhead is minimal)
- **Zero allocation:** No GC pressure for basic events
- **Use case:** Acceptable for most scenarios

#### Learning Curve

- **Very easy:** Just a static class with events
- **Immediate productivity:** No new concepts
- **Estimated learning time:** 10 minutes

#### Ease of Understanding

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easy initially, hard at scale)
- Simple pattern to grasp
- Becomes messy with 20+ events
- Hard to track ownership and responsibilities

#### When Static Event Bus Wins

- ‚úÖ You've already built one and it works
- ‚úÖ Very simple use cases (just need globals)
- ‚úÖ Small projects (<10 events)
- ‚úÖ No framework dependencies desired
- ‚úÖ Quick prototypes

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ‚úÖ More than 10-15 events (organization becomes important)
- ‚úÖ Memory leaks are a concern (automatic lifecycle management)
- ‚úÖ Execution order matters (priority-based handlers)
- ‚úÖ Need message validation/interception (interceptor pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Testing is important (local buses for isolation)
- ‚úÖ Observability needed (Inspector debugging, message history)
- ‚úÖ Multiple subsystems (namespacing and organization)
- ‚úÖ GameObject/Component targeting needed
- ‚úÖ Global observation needed (listen to all message instances)
- ‚úÖ Post-processing needed (analytics after handlers)
- ‚úÖ Long-term maintenance (structure prevents chaos)

| **Inspector Debugging**  | ‚ùå No                 | ‚úÖ History + stats     |
| **Interceptors**         | ‚ùå Not built-in       | ‚úÖ Full pipeline       |
| **Global Observers**     | ‚ùå Not built-in       | ‚úÖ Listen to all       |
| **Post-Processing**      | ‚ùå Not built-in       | ‚úÖ Dedicated stage     |

| **Decoupling**           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Good         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent   |
| **Organization**         | ‚≠ê‚≠ê One big class    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Structured  |

**Bottom Line:** Static event buses solve global access but inherit all the problems of C# events (leaks, undefined order, no observability). DxMessaging provides the same global access with lifecycle safety, structure, and debugging tools.

**Migration Path:** DxMessaging can replace static event buses gradually:

```csharp
// Old static event bus
EventHub.RaiseDamage(5);

// DxMessaging equivalent (global bus)
new TookDamage(5).Emit();

// Or use local buses for subsystems
var combatBus = new MessageBus();
new TookDamage(5).Emit(combatBus);
```

## Honest Trade-offs: What You Give Up, What You Gain

**Let's be real:** DxMessaging isn't free magic. You trade some things for others. Here's the unfiltered truth about what you gain and what you sacrifice.

**Bottom line first:** For game jam prototypes, C# events are faster to write. For anything you'll maintain for months, DxMessaging saves you time and sanity.

### Learning Curve

#### What You Give Up

- ‚ùå **Immediate productivity** - ~1-2 days to feel comfortable (reading docs, trying examples)
- ‚ùå **Familiarity** - Your team knows C# events already; DxMessaging is new
- ‚ùå **"Just works" intuition** - You need to think: "Which message type? What priority?"

**Real talk:** Your first message will take 15 minutes. By the 10th message, you'll be faster than with events.

#### What You Gain

- ‚úÖ **Long-term velocity** - Adding new features doesn't require touching 5 existing systems
- ‚úÖ **Debugging is 10x faster** - Inspector shows "what fired when" instantly
- ‚úÖ **Onboarding is easier** - New devs see explicit message contracts, not hidden event chains

**Example:** Junior dev asks "How does damage work?"

- **C# events:** "Uh, Player has an OnDamaged event, and HealthBar subscribes in line 47, and..."
- **DxMessaging:** "Search for `TookDamage` message, see who emits it and who listens."

##### Verdict

- Game jam (1 week project): Learning curve not worth it ‚Üí Stick with C# events
- Mid-size game (1+ month): Pays off by week 2
- Large game (6+ months): Essential for sanity

### Boilerplate

#### What You Give Up

- ‚ùå "One-liners" - C# events can be `public event Action OnClick;` done
- ‚ùå Quick and dirty - Need to define message struct, attributes, handler registration

#### What You Gain

- ‚úÖ Explicit contracts - Messages are discoverable types, not hidden delegates
- ‚úÖ Auto-generated code - `[DxAutoConstructor]` reduces boilerplate
- ‚úÖ Compile-time safety - Refactors update all usages

#### Example Comparison

```csharp
// C# Event (minimal boilerplate)
public event Action<int> OnDamage;
OnDamage?.Invoke(5);

// DxMessaging (more upfront definition)
[DxBroadcastMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct TookDamage { public readonly int amount; }

var msg = new TookDamage(5);
msg.EmitGameObjectBroadcast(gameObject);
```

**Verdict:** For 1-3 simple events, C# events win on brevity. For 10+ events with complex flows, DxMessaging's structure pays dividends.

### Performance

#### What You Give Up

- ‚ùå Absolute minimal overhead - Raw C# events/delegates are faster (~10ns per call)
- ‚ùå Zero abstraction cost - Direct calls can be inlined by the compiler
- ‚ùå Simplicity in profiler - One extra layer in call stack

#### What You Gain

- ‚úÖ Zero-allocation struct messages - No GC pressure from boxing
- ‚úÖ Predictable performance - No hidden allocations from lambdas
- ‚úÖ Scalable diagnostics - Built-in profiling/logging without custom instrumentation

#### Hard Numbers

- C# event invoke: ~50ns baseline
- DxMessaging handler: ~60ns (~10ns overhead)
- Memory: Zero allocations for struct messages

**Verdict:** For UI, gameplay events, scene management ‚Üí DxMessaging overhead is negligible. For ECS with millions of events/frame ‚Üí stick with raw delegates or native code.

### Flexibility

#### What You Give Up

- ‚ùå Return values - DxMessaging is fire-and-forget (no synchronous responses)
- ‚ùå Out parameters - Can't use `out` or `ref` for bidirectional communication
- ‚ùå Dynamic subscriptions - Can't easily pass lambdas inline

#### What You Gain

- ‚úÖ Interception - Validate/transform messages before handlers
- ‚úÖ Post-processing - Analytics/logging without polluting handlers
- ‚úÖ Priority control - Explicit execution order
- ‚úÖ Context - Always know who sent/received

#### When Limitations Hurt

```csharp
// C# events can return values (DxMessaging can't)
public delegate bool DamageValidator(int amount);
public event DamageValidator OnValidateDamage;

if (OnValidateDamage?.Invoke(damage) == true) {
    // Allowed
}

// DxMessaging workaround: Use interceptors or separate query pattern
```

**Verdict:** If you need synchronous request/response, C# delegates/events or direct method calls are better. DxMessaging excels at notifications and commands.

### Debuggability

#### What You Give Up

- ‚ùå Simplicity - Stack traces show message bus internals
- ‚ùå Step-through - Can't F11 directly from emit to handler (need breakpoints)

#### What You Gain

- ‚úÖ Message history - See last N messages in Inspector
- ‚úÖ Registration view - Know exactly who's listening
- ‚úÖ Global observability - Track all messages without instrumenting code
- ‚úÖ Filtering - Intercept messages for debugging without changing code

#### Example: Finding Who Fired a Message

```csharp
// C# events: Set breakpoint on every possible Invoke(), or add logging everywhere
OnDamage?.Invoke(5); // Where did this come from??

// DxMessaging: Check Inspector message history or add global logger
_ = debugToken.RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource<TookDamage>(
    (src, msg) => Debug.Log($"Damage from {src}: {msg.amount}")
);
```

**Verdict:** Initial debugging is slightly harder (extra layer), but systemic debugging is MUCH easier (observability tools).

### Coupling and Architecture

#### What You Give Up

- ‚ùå Quick hacks - Can't just `GetComponent<T>().DoThing()` anymore
- ‚ùå Direct inspector wiring - Can't drag-and-drop references to emit messages

#### What You Gain

- ‚úÖ True decoupling - Systems don't know about each other
- ‚úÖ Testability - Easy to isolate with local buses
- ‚úÖ Refactorability - Move/rename components without breaking wiring

#### Impact on Architecture

Before (tight coupling):

```text
UI ‚Üí References 15 systems
System A ‚Üí References System B, C, D
Every change ripples through dependencies
```

After (loose coupling):

```text
All systems ‚Üí Emit messages
All systems ‚Üí Listen to messages
Add/remove systems without affecting others
```

**Verdict:** If your project is <5k lines, tight coupling is manageable. For larger projects, DxMessaging's decoupling is essential for sanity.

### Testing

#### What You Give Up

- ‚ùå Simplicity - Can't just mock an event subscription

#### What You Gain

- ‚úÖ Isolation - Local buses per test, zero global state
- ‚úÖ Observability - Count messages, inspect payloads easily
- ‚úÖ Determinism - Priority-based ordering eliminates flakiness

##### Example

```csharp
// Test with isolated bus
[Test]
public void TestAchievementSystem() {
    var testBus = new MessageBus();
    var token = MessageRegistrationToken.Create(achievementHandler, testBus);

    var msg = new EnemyKilled("Boss", 10);
    msg.EmitGameObjectBroadcast(enemy, testBus);

    Assert.IsTrue(achievementSystem.Unlocked("BossSlayer"));
}
```

**Verdict:** DxMessaging makes integration testing easier, unit testing slightly more verbose.

### Overall Verdict by Use Case

- **Small prototype/jam:** C# Events or UnityEvents win (simplicity > all)
- **Mid-size game (5-20k lines):** DxMessaging starts paying off (decoupling, debugging)
- **Large game (20k+ lines):** DxMessaging essential for maintainability
- **Designer-driven workflow:** SOA has value (Inspector wiring) but consider maintenance costs
- **Legacy SOA project:** Use Pattern B (keep SOs for configs, migrate events to DxMessaging)
- **Performance-critical (millions of messages/frame):** MessagePipe wins (highest throughput)
- **Performance-critical (Unity-specific):** DxMessaging (excellent perf + Unity integration)
- **UI-heavy:** DxMessaging excels (decoupled updates, global observers for UI state)
- **Complex event transformations:** UniRx wins (reactive stream operators)
- **DI-first architecture:** MessagePipe or Zenject Signals win (DI integration)
- **Analytics/diagnostics heavy:** DxMessaging wins (global observers, post-processors, Inspector)
- **Need execution control:** DxMessaging wins (priorities, interceptors, ordered stages)

## When Each Approach ACTUALLY Wins

### DxMessaging Wins When

- ‚úÖ Unity-first projects (MonoBehaviour lifecycle integration)
- ‚úÖ 10+ systems that communicate (pub/sub decoupling)
- ‚úÖ Observability essential (Inspector debugging, message history)
- ‚úÖ Memory leaks are a pain point (automatic lifecycle management)
- ‚úÖ Cross-team development (clear message contracts)
- ‚úÖ Long-term maintenance (years, not weeks)
- ‚úÖ GameObject/Component targeting needed (Unity-specific patterns)
- ‚úÖ Execution order control essential (priority-based handlers)
- ‚úÖ Message validation/transformation needed (interceptor pipeline)
- ‚úÖ Global observation needed (listen to all message instances)
- ‚úÖ Post-processing needed (analytics, logging after handlers)
- ‚úÖ Late update semantics needed (timing-specific processing)
- ‚úÖ Teams without DI experience (no framework dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Want plug-and-play solution (zero dependencies, immediate use)

### UniRx Wins When

- ‚úÖ Simple pub/sub with minimal setup (MessageBroker is extremely easy)
- ‚úÖ Complex event stream transformations needed
- ‚úÖ Time-based operations (throttle, debounce, buffer)
- ‚úÖ Combining multiple input sources
- ‚úÖ Reactive UI data binding
- ‚úÖ Team familiar with reactive programming
- ‚úÖ Need LINQ-style query operators on events
- ‚úÖ Async operations with cancellation and composition

### MessagePipe Wins When

- ‚úÖ Performance is THE priority (highest throughput)
- ‚úÖ Already using DI (VContainer, Zenject, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform .NET projects (not Unity-only)
- ‚úÖ Need native async/await support
- ‚úÖ Large-scale projects with DI architecture
- ‚úÖ Want compile-time leak detection (Roslyn analyzer)
- ‚úÖ High message frequency (thousands/frame)

### Zenject Signals Win When

- ‚úÖ Already using Zenject for dependency injection
- ‚úÖ Testability through DI is critical
- ‚úÖ Need subscriber validation (ensure handlers exist)
- ‚úÖ Team experienced with Zenject
- ‚úÖ Want DI-managed lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing Zenject architecture

### C# Events Win When

- ‚úÖ You need return values or out parameters
- ‚úÖ Writing a library (DxMessaging is Unity-specific)
- ‚úÖ Small, stable scope (5-10 events max)
- ‚úÖ Team is C# experts, Unity beginners

### UnityEvents Win When

- ‚úÖ Designers need to wire logic without code
- ‚úÖ Rapid prototyping with prefabs
- ‚úÖ Very simple games (mobile casual, hyper-casual)

### SOA (GameEvent/Variables) Wins When

- ‚úÖ Designers must create and wire events without touching code
- ‚úÖ Team is already heavily invested in SOA with many existing assets
- ‚úÖ Designer empowerment is the absolute top priority
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BUT:** Consider migration costs and maintainability issues (see [Anti-SOA critique](https://github.com/cathei/AntiScriptableObjectArchitecture))
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Alternative:** Use ScriptableObjects for configs only + DxMessaging for events (Pattern B in [SOA Guide](Patterns.md#14-compatibility-with-scriptable-object-architecture-soa))

### Static Event Bus Wins When

- ‚úÖ You've already built one and it works
- ‚úÖ Very simple use cases (just need globals)

## Cost-Benefit Summary

### Costs

1. Learning curve (~1-2 days to feel comfortable)
1. More upfront code (message definitions)
1. Slightly slower than raw C# events (~10ns/call)
1. Can't return values (fire-and-forget only)

### Benefits

1. Zero memory leaks (automatic lifecycle)
1. Full decoupling (systems don't reference each other)
1. Observability (Inspector diagnostics, message history)
1. Predictable ordering (priority-based execution)
1. Interception/validation (before handlers run)
1. Testability (isolated buses)

**Break-even point:** Usually around 10-20 hours into a project, when event management becomes painful.

## Making the Decision (Be Honest With Yourself)

### Answer these questions honestly

### 1. Project Lifespan?

- **<1 week (game jam):** Skip DxMessaging ‚Üí Use C# events or direct calls
- **1-4 weeks (prototype):** Maybe ‚Üí If you plan to continue, use DxMessaging
- **1+ months (real project):** Yes ‚Üí DxMessaging will save you time
- **6+ months (production):** Absolutely ‚Üí You'll thank yourself later

### 2. Team Size?

- **Solo dev:** Optional ‚Üí Depends on project complexity
- **2-3 devs:** Valuable ‚Üí Reduces communication overhead
- **4+ devs:** Highly recommended ‚Üí Clear contracts between systems
- **Remote/distributed team:** Essential ‚Üí Explicit message contracts prevent miscommunication

### 3. Codebase Size?

- **<1k lines:** Skip it ‚Üí Direct method calls are fine
- **1k-5k lines:** Consider it ‚Üí If you're growing fast
- **5k-20k lines:** Recommended ‚Üí Coupling becomes painful
- **20k+ lines:** Absolutely ‚Üí Refactoring without it is a nightmare

### 4. How Many Systems Need to Communicate?

- **1-2 systems:** Skip ‚Üí Just call methods directly
- **3-5 systems:** Consider ‚Üí If they don't share references
- **6-10 systems:** Recommended ‚Üí Coupling becomes unmanageable
- **10+ systems:** Essential ‚Üí You're drowning in SerializeFields

### 5. Have You Had Memory Leaks From Forgotten Unsubscribes?

- **Never:** Lucky you! Optional
- **Once or twice:** Consider it ‚Üí Prevention is cheaper than debugging
- **Multiple times:** Absolutely ‚Üí Stop wasting time on this
- **Currently debugging one:** Drop everything and adopt DxMessaging now

### 6. How Often Do You Debug "What Fired When?"

- **Never:** You're either lying or working on tiny projects
- **Rarely:** Optional, but would help
- **Monthly:** Recommended ‚Üí Inspector diagnostics will save hours
- **Weekly:** Absolutely ‚Üí You're wasting too much time

### Quick Decision Matrix

```text
Game Jam         ‚Üí C# Events (speed over safety)
Prototype        ‚Üí DxMessaging IF continuing, else C# Events
Production       ‚Üí DxMessaging (unless <1k lines)
Legacy codebase  ‚Üí Migrate gradually (see Migration Guide)
```

### The Real Question

#### "Will this project still exist in 3 months?"

- **No:** C# events are fine
- **Yes:** Use DxMessaging

##### "Will anyone else work on this code?"

- **No:** C# events might be okay
- **Yes:** Use DxMessaging (future you counts as "someone else")

### Rule of Thumb

If you're reading this and thinking:

- **"I've experienced these pain points"** ‚Üí DxMessaging will help
- **"This seems like overkill"** ‚Üí You probably don't need it yet
- **"I need this yesterday"** ‚Üí Welcome home üöÄ

## Unity Messaging Frameworks

This section compares DxMessaging with other popular Unity messaging/eventing libraries. Each offers different approaches to solving communication and decoupling problems in Unity.

### Quick Summary: Which Framework to Choose?

**TL;DR Decision Tree:**

```text
Need complex event stream transformations (debounce, throttle, combine)?
  → Use UniRx (reactive programming paradigm)

Already using Dependency Injection (Zenject, VContainer)?
  → Use MessagePipe (DI-first, best performance) or Zenject Signals (if on Zenject)

Need Unity-specific features (GameObject targeting, Inspector debugging)?
  → Use DxMessaging (Unity-first design)

Want plug-and-play with zero dependencies?
  → Use DxMessaging (no setup required)

Maximum performance is THE priority?
  → Use MessagePipe (78x faster than alternatives)

Simple pub/sub with automatic lifecycle management?
  → Use DxMessaging (automatic cleanup, priorities, validation)
```

**One-Line Summary for Each:**

- **DxMessaging:** Unity-first pub/sub with automatic lifecycle, priorities, and Inspector debugging
- **UniRx:** Reactive programming with LINQ-style stream operators for complex event transformations
- **MessagePipe:** DI-first, best-in-class performance for high-frequency messaging
- **Zenject Signals:** Decoupled messaging integrated with Zenject dependency injection

---

### UniRx (Reactive Extensions for Unity)

**What It Is:** A reactive programming library that treats events as observable streams. Based on .NET Reactive Extensions (Rx), reimplemented for Unity with IL2CPP compatibility.

**Core Philosophy:** Everything is a stream that can be observed, filtered, combined, and transformed using LINQ-style operators.

#### Key Features

- **Stream-based programming:** Transform events into observable sequences
- **LINQ operators:** `Where`, `Select`, `Merge`, `CombineLatest`, `Buffer`, etc.
- **Async operations:** Convert coroutines to observables with cancellation support
- **Multithreading:** Thread-safe operations with main thread synchronization
- **Time operators:** Frame-based and time-based event handling
- **UI integration:** Observable extensions for Unity UI events

#### Code Example

```csharp
// Double-click detection using reactive operators
Observable.EveryUpdate()
    .Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
    .Buffer(Observable.Timer(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250)))
    .Where(xs => xs.Count >= 2)
    .Subscribe(_ => Debug.Log("Double Click!"));

// Combine multiple input streams
var leftClick = Observable.EveryUpdate().Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0));
var rightClick = Observable.EveryUpdate().Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1));
leftClick.Merge(rightClick).Subscribe(_ => Debug.Log("Any click!"));
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Complex event streams:** Chain, filter, combine, and transform events elegantly
- ✅ **Async operations:** Better async/await alternative with cancellation
- ✅ **Temporal logic:** Time-based operations (throttle, debounce, sample)
- ✅ **UI reactivity:** Bind UI elements to data streams reactively
- ✅ **Memory management:** Disposable subscriptions prevent leaks

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **Simple pub/sub:** Overkill for basic "emit and listen" scenarios
- ❌ **Execution order control:** No built-in priority system
- ❌ **Message validation:** No interception pipeline for validation
- ❌ **Observability:** No Inspector integration to see what fired when
- ❌ **Direct targeting:** Not designed for "send message to specific GameObject"

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Allocations:** Can allocate on subscription/disposal; stream operators may allocate
- **Overhead:** Higher than simple events due to observable infrastructure
- **Use case:** Best for complex event transformations; overhead justified by functionality

#### Learning Curve

- **Steep for beginners:** Requires understanding reactive programming paradigm
- **Mental model shift:** Think in streams, not events
- **Documentation:** Extensive examples, but reactive concepts take time to master
- **Estimated learning time:** 1-2 weeks to become productive

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate to difficult)
- Code is concise but requires understanding of operators
- Hard to debug without understanding observable chains
- Team buy-in essential; not intuitive for traditional event-driven developers

#### When UniRx Wins

- ✅ Complex event transformations (e.g., double-click, gesture detection)
- ✅ Combining multiple input sources
- ✅ Time-based logic (debounce, throttle, sample)
- ✅ UI data binding with reactive updates
- ✅ Teams familiar with reactive programming

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ Simple pub/sub patterns
- ✅ Execution order matters (priorities)
- ✅ Message validation/interception needed
- ✅ Inspector debugging required
- ✅ Direct GameObject/Component targeting
- ✅ Teams unfamiliar with reactive programming

#### Direct Comparison

| Aspect                    | UniRx                   | DxMessaging               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Primary Use Case**      | Stream transformations  | Pub/sub messaging         |
| **Learning Curve**        | ⭐⭐ (Steep)           | ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)         |
| **Execution Order**       | ❌ Not built-in        | ✅ Priority-based         |
| **Validation/Intercept**  | ❌ Not built-in        | ✅ Built-in               |
| **Inspector Debugging**   | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes                    |
| **Temporal Operators**    | ✅ Extensive            | ❌ Not built-in           |
| **Complex Stream Logic**  | ✅ Excellent            | ❌ Not designed for       |
| **Simple Messaging**      | ⚠️ Overkill           | ✅ Optimized for          |
| **Memory Management**     | ⚠️ Manual dispose      | ✅ Automatic lifecycle    |
| **GameObject Targeting**  | ❌ Not designed for    | ✅ Built-in               |

**Bottom Line:** UniRx excels at complex event stream transformations and reactive programming patterns. DxMessaging excels at straightforward pub/sub communication with control, validation, and debugging. Use UniRx when you need stream operators; use DxMessaging when you need reliable messaging.

### MessagePipe (High-Performance Messaging)

**What It Is:** A high-performance, DI-first messaging library by Cysharp (creators of UniTask). Designed for in-memory and distributed messaging with zero-allocation focus.

**Core Philosophy:** Maximum performance with dependency injection integration. Support all messaging patterns with a unified, generic interface.

#### Key Features

- **Multiple patterns:** Pub/Sub, Request/Response, Mediator patterns
- **Sync and async:** Full async/await support with configurable strategies (sequential/parallel)
- **Keyed messaging:** Type-based or key-based message routing
- **DI-first design:** Deep integration with dependency injection containers
- **Filters:** Pre/post execution customization (similar to interceptors)
- **Zero allocation:** Struct messages with zero GC per publish
- **Roslyn analyzer:** Detects subscription leaks at compile-time
- **Global and scoped:** Support for global message bus or scoped instances

#### Code Example

```csharp
// Using MessagePipe with DI
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private IPublisher<EnemySpawned> _publisher;
    private IDisposable _subscription;

    void Start()
    {
        // Injected via DI container
        _publisher = GlobalMessagePipe.GetPublisher<EnemySpawned>();
        var subscriber = GlobalMessagePipe.GetSubscriber<EnemySpawned>();

        _subscription = subscriber.Subscribe(msg =>
        {
            Debug.Log($"Enemy spawned: {msg.EnemyId}");
        });
    }

    void SpawnEnemy(int id)
    {
        _publisher.Publish(new EnemySpawned { EnemyId = id });
    }

    void OnDestroy() => _subscription?.Dispose();
}

// Async handler with filters
public class AchievementSystem
{
    public AchievementSystem(IAsyncSubscriber<EnemyKilled> subscriber)
    {
        subscriber.Subscribe(async (msg, cancellationToken) =>
        {
            await SaveAchievementAsync(msg.EnemyType);
        });
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Performance:** 78x faster than Prism EventAggregator, zero allocations
- ✅ **DI integration:** First-class support for dependency injection
- ✅ **Async messaging:** Native async/await without blocking
- ✅ **Leak detection:** Analyzer catches forgotten subscriptions at compile-time
- ✅ **Flexibility:** Keyed, keyless, buffered, request/response patterns
- ✅ **Cross-platform:** Works in Unity, .NET, Blazor, etc.

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **Unity integration:** No built-in Unity lifecycle management
- ❌ **Inspector debugging:** No visual debugging in Unity Inspector
- ❌ **GameObject targeting:** Not designed for Unity-specific targeting
- ❌ **Execution order:** No priority system (relies on subscription order)
- ❌ **Setup complexity:** Requires DI container setup (not plug-and-play)

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Best-in-class:** Claims 78x faster than Prism, faster than C# events in some scenarios
- **Zero allocation:** Struct-based messages with no GC per publish
- **Benchmark data:** See performance section above for actual numbers
- **Use case:** Optimized for high-frequency messaging (thousands/frame)

#### Learning Curve

- **Moderate:** Requires understanding of dependency injection
- **DI knowledge:** Must be comfortable with service provider pattern
- **Generic interfaces:** Multiple generic types can be confusing initially
- **Estimated learning time:** 2-3 days with DI experience; 1 week without

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)
- Clean, generic interfaces once you understand DI
- Code is straightforward for developers familiar with DI patterns
- Harder for teams without DI experience

#### When MessagePipe Wins

- ✅ Performance-critical applications (high message throughput)
- ✅ Projects already using DI (VContainer, Zenject, etc.)
- ✅ Cross-platform .NET projects (not Unity-only)
- ✅ Need async messaging with cancellation
- ✅ Large-scale projects with DI architecture
- ✅ Teams experienced with DI patterns

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ Unity-first projects (not cross-platform)
- ✅ Need Unity lifecycle management (GameObject/Component awareness)
- ✅ Inspector debugging essential
- ✅ Execution order control needed (priorities)
- ✅ Message validation/interception required
- ✅ Teams without DI experience
- ✅ Projects not using DI architecture

#### Direct Comparison

| Aspect                   | MessagePipe              | DxMessaging              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Performance**          | ✅ Best-in-class (78x)   | ✅ Excellent (~60ns)     |
| **Allocations**          | ✅ Zero                  | ✅ Zero                  |
| **Unity Integration**    | ⚠️ Basic                | ✅ Deep (lifecycle-aware)|
| **DI Integration**       | ✅ First-class           | ⚠️ Optional             |
| **Async/Await**          | ✅ Native support        | ⚠️ Manual via async void|
| **Inspector Debugging**  | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes                   |
| **Execution Order**      | ❌ Subscription order    | ✅ Priority-based        |
| **Leak Detection**       | ✅ Roslyn analyzer       | ✅ Automatic lifecycle   |
| **Setup Complexity**     | ⚠️ DI container required| ✅ Plug-and-play         |
| **GameObject Targeting** | ❌ Not built-in          | ✅ Built-in              |
| **Learning Curve**       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (DI needed)    | ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)        |

**Bottom Line:** MessagePipe is the performance king with DI-first design. DxMessaging is Unity-first with lifecycle awareness and debugging. Use MessagePipe if you have DI infrastructure and need maximum performance. Use DxMessaging if you want Unity-native messaging with automatic lifecycle management.

### Zenject Signals (DI-Based Messaging)

**What It Is:** The built-in messaging system for Zenject (Extenject), a dependency injection framework for Unity. Signals are an optional extension that provides decoupled communication.

**Core Philosophy:** Loosely coupled messaging integrated with dependency injection. Reduce direct dependencies between classes while maintaining testability.

#### Key Features

- **DI-integrated:** Signals declared and resolved via Zenject container
- **Typed signals:** Strongly-typed signal classes with parameters
- **Synchronous and async:** Sync (RunSync) and async (RunAsync) execution modes
- **Subscription modes:** Require, optional, or optional-with-warning subscribers
- **Installer-based setup:** Declare signals in installers for container binding
- **Multiple subscription methods:** Direct binding, SignalBus subscription, stream-based (with UniRx)
- **Testable:** Easy to mock and test with dependency injection

#### Code Example

```csharp
// 1. Define signal
public class EnemyKilledSignal
{
    public string EnemyType;
    public int Score;
}

// 2. Install and declare in installer
public class GameInstaller : MonoInstaller
{
    public override void InstallBindings()
    {
        SignalBusInstaller.Install(Container);
        Container.DeclareSignal<EnemyKilledSignal>();
        Container.BindSignal<EnemyKilledSignal>()
            .ToMethod<AchievementSystem>(x => x.OnEnemyKilled)
            .FromResolve();
    }
}

// 3. Fire signal
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Inject] private SignalBus _signalBus;

    void Die()
    {
        _signalBus.Fire(new EnemyKilledSignal
        {
            EnemyType = "Orc",
            Score = 100
        });
    }
}

// 4. Subscribe to signal
public class AchievementSystem
{
    [Inject] private SignalBus _signalBus;

    public void Initialize()
    {
        _signalBus.Subscribe<EnemyKilledSignal>(OnEnemyKilled);
    }

    void OnEnemyKilled(EnemyKilledSignal signal)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Killed {signal.EnemyType} for {signal.Score} points!");
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Decoupling:** Classes communicate without direct references
- ✅ **DI integration:** Seamless with Zenject dependency injection
- ✅ **Testability:** Easy to mock SignalBus in tests
- ✅ **Type safety:** Strongly-typed signal classes
- ✅ **Subscriber validation:** Can enforce required subscribers
- ✅ **Async support:** Fire signals synchronously or asynchronously

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **Zenject dependency:** Must use Zenject; not standalone
- ❌ **Performance:** Higher overhead than direct messaging (DI + signal bus)
- ❌ **Execution order:** No priority system
- ❌ **Inspector debugging:** No visual message history
- ❌ **Allocations:** Signal parameters often boxed/allocated
- ❌ **Complex flows:** No interceptor or validation pipeline

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Overhead:** Higher than lightweight messaging (DI resolution + boxing)
- **Allocations:** Signal parameters can cause allocations (depends on implementation)
- **Benchmark data:** See performance section above for actual numbers
- **Use case:** Performance trade-off for testability and DI benefits

#### Learning Curve

- **Moderate to steep:** Requires understanding Zenject dependency injection
- **Zenject knowledge:** Must learn Zenject before signals
- **Setup overhead:** Installers, bindings, container configuration
- **Estimated learning time:** 1 week for Zenject + signals together

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)
- Clear once you understand Zenject
- Signal concept is straightforward
- Setup (installers, bindings) adds complexity

#### When Zenject Signals Win

- ✅ Already using Zenject for dependency injection
- ✅ Testability is critical (DI makes mocking easy)
- ✅ Need subscriber validation (ensure handlers exist)
- ✅ Team experienced with Zenject
- ✅ Want DI-managed lifecycle

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ Not using Zenject (or any DI framework)
- ✅ Performance critical
- ✅ Need execution order control (priorities)
- ✅ Inspector debugging required
- ✅ Message validation/interception needed
- ✅ Want zero-allocation messaging
- ✅ GameObject/Component targeting needed

#### Direct Comparison

| Aspect                   | Zenject Signals         | DxMessaging              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **DI Integration**       | ✅ Required (Zenject)   | ⚠️ Optional              |
| **Standalone**           | ❌ Zenject dependency   | ✅ No dependencies       |
| **Performance**          | ⚠️ Higher overhead     | ✅ Low overhead          |
| **Allocations**          | ⚠️ Can allocate        | ✅ Zero (structs)        |
| **Execution Order**      | ❌ Not built-in         | ✅ Priority-based        |
| **Inspector Debugging**  | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes                   |
| **Testability**          | ✅ DI makes easy        | ✅ Local buses          |
| **Validation**           | ⚠️ Subscriber check    | ✅ Interceptor pipeline  |
| **Learning Curve**       | ⭐⭐ (Zenject + Signals)| ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)        |
| **Setup Complexity**     | ⚠️ Installers required | ✅ Plug-and-play         |
| **GameObject Targeting** | ❌ Not built-in         | ✅ Built-in              |

**Bottom Line:** Zenject Signals are great if you're already invested in Zenject and value testability through DI. DxMessaging is better if you want standalone messaging without DI overhead, with better performance and Unity integration.

## Traditional Approaches

### Standard C# Events/Actions

### The Pain Points (You've Felt These)

#### 1. Memory Leak Hell

```csharp
public class UI : MonoBehaviour {
    void OnEnable() {
        GameManager.Instance.OnScoreChanged += UpdateScore;
    }

    void OnDisable() {
        // ❌ Forgot this line? MEMORY LEAK!
        GameManager.Instance.OnScoreChanged -= UpdateScore;
    }
}
```

**Real story:** You forget `OnDisable` once. Six months later: "Why is our mobile game crashing after 30 minutes?"

##### 2. Tight Coupling Nightmare

```csharp
public class Spawner {
    public event Action Spawned;
    public void Spawn() => Spawned?.Invoke();
}

public class UI {
    // ❌ UI now depends on Spawner directly
    [SerializeField] private Spawner spawner;

    void Awake() {
        spawner.Spawned += OnSpawned;  // Tight coupling
    }
}
```

**Problem:** Want to add a second spawner? Refactor Spawner? Hope you like breaking things.

###### 3. Mystery Execution Order

```csharp
// Which runs first? 🤷
AudioSystem.OnGameEnd += FadeMusic;
SaveSystem.OnGameEnd += SaveGame;
UISystem.OnGameEnd += ShowCredits;
```

**Result:** Sometimes SaveGame runs after UISystem shows credits. Flaky bugs that only happen sometimes.

###### 4. Debugging Black Hole

"Which event fired when? Who's subscribed?" → Set 50 breakpoints and hope.

### The DxMessaging Way

#### 1. Impossible to Leak

```csharp
public class UI : MessageAwareComponent {
    protected override void RegisterMessageHandlers() {
        base.RegisterMessageHandlers();
        _ = Token.RegisterUntargeted<ScoreChanged>(UpdateScore);
    }
    // ✅ That's it! Automatic cleanup when destroyed.
}
```

##### 2. Zero Coupling

```csharp
// Spawner doesn't know about UI
public class Spawner : MonoBehaviour {
    void Spawn() {
        // Just emit, don't care who's listening
        new SpawnedEnemy().Emit();
    }
}

// UI doesn't know about Spawner
public class UI : MessageAwareComponent {
    protected override void RegisterMessageHandlers() {
        _ = Token.RegisterUntargeted<SpawnedEnemy>(OnSpawn);
    }
}
```

###### 3. Explicit Execution Order

```csharp
// Clear, documented order
AudioSystem:  priority: 10  // Runs third
SaveSystem:   priority: 0   // Runs first
UISystem:     priority: 5   // Runs second
```

###### 4. Built-in Debugging

Open any component in Inspector → See message history with timestamps. Done.

## UnityEvents (Inspector Wiring)

Problems

- Great for small demos, but brittle at scale (hidden references, order issues, refactors break wiring).
- No interception or post‑processing stages to validate/normalize.

Typical code

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

public sealed class Button : MonoBehaviour
{
    public UnityEvent onClicked; // wired in Inspector
    public void Click() => onClicked?.Invoke();
}

public sealed class UI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void Refresh() { /* ... */ }
}
```

DxMessaging

- Strongly‑typed registrations in code; explicit priorities and stages.
- Inspect and page through emissions/registrations from MessagingComponent inspector.

## Unity SendMessage

Problems

- String‑based; no compile‑time checking. 0/1 parameter only; boxing costs.
- Hard to reason about who handles what; debugging is difficult.

DxMessaging

- Use `ReflexiveMessage` to bridge legacy SendMessage behavior into the bus pipeline (optional).
- Prefer typed messages for new code; multiple parameters via fields, by‑ref handlers avoid boxing.

```csharp
using DxMessaging.Core;
using DxMessaging.Core.Messages;

InstanceId target = gameObject;
var msg = new ReflexiveMessage("OnHit", ReflexiveSendMode.Upwards, 10);
MessageHandler.MessageBus.TargetedBroadcast(ref target, ref msg);
```

## Global Event Bus Singletons

Problems

- Often devolves to one giant bag of static events; naming, ownership, and routing semantics get muddy.
- Still manual lifecycle and ordering issues.

Typical code

```csharp
public static class EventHub
{
    public static event Action<int> Damage;
    public static void RaiseDamage(int amount) => Damage?.Invoke(amount);
}

// Producer
EventHub.RaiseDamage(5);

// Consumer
EventHub.Damage += amount => Log(amount);
```

Problems: everything is global, ownership unclear, no interceptors, no context (who sent/received), hard to test.

DxMessaging

- A single `MessageBus` with clear categories: Untargeted (global), Targeted (to one), Broadcast (from one).
- Interceptors and post‑processors provide a structured pipeline.
- You can create isolated buses for sub‑systems or tests (local islands), and keep a global default (`MessageHandler.MessageBus`).

```csharp
using DxMessaging.Core;
using DxMessaging.Core.MessageBus;
using DxMessaging.Core.Messages;
using DxMessaging.Core.Attributes;

[DxBroadcastMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct TookDamage { public readonly int amount; }

// Local bus for combat system
var bus = new MessageBus();
var handler = new MessageHandler(new InstanceId(1)) { active = true };
var token = MessageRegistrationToken.Create(handler, bus);

_ = token.RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource<TookDamage>(OnAnyDamage);
void OnAnyDamage(ref InstanceId src, ref TookDamage m) => Log(src, m.amount);

// Emit within subsystem
var hit = new TookDamage(5);
hit.EmitGameObjectTargeted(enemyGO, bus);
```

When to use which

- C# events: simple, local wiring within a class or small module.
- UnityEvents: quick prototypes/small scenes; prefer code for maintainability.
- Unity SendMessage: legacy only; prefer `ReflexiveMessage` if you must bridge.
- DxMessaging: decoupled, cross‑system flows where ordering, observability, and lifecycle safety matter.

## Honest Trade-offs: What You Give Up, What You Gain

**Let's be real:** DxMessaging isn't free magic. You trade some things for others. Here's the unfiltered truth about what you gain and what you sacrifice.

**Bottom line first:** For game jam prototypes, C# events are faster to write. For anything you'll maintain for months, DxMessaging saves you time and sanity.

### Learning Curve

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ **Immediate productivity** - ~1-2 days to feel comfortable (reading docs, trying examples)
- ❌ **Familiarity** - Your team knows C# events already; DxMessaging is new
- ❌ **"Just works" intuition** - You need to think: "Which message type? What priority?"

**Real talk:** Your first message will take 15 minutes. By the 10th message, you'll be faster than with events.

#### What You Gain

- ✅ **Long-term velocity** - Adding new features doesn't require touching 5 existing systems
- ✅ **Debugging is 10x faster** - Inspector shows "what fired when" instantly
- ✅ **Onboarding is easier** - New devs see explicit message contracts, not hidden event chains

**Example:** Junior dev asks "How does damage work?"

- **C# events:** "Uh, Player has an OnDamaged event, and HealthBar subscribes in line 47, and..."
- **DxMessaging:** "Search for `TookDamage` message, see who emits it and who listens."

##### Verdict

- Game jam (1 week project): Learning curve not worth it → Stick with C# events
- Mid-size game (1+ month): Pays off by week 2
- Large game (6+ months): Essential for sanity

### Boilerplate

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ "One-liners" - C# events can be `public event Action OnClick;` done
- ❌ Quick and dirty - Need to define message struct, attributes, handler registration

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Explicit contracts - Messages are discoverable types, not hidden delegates
- ✅ Auto-generated code - `[DxAutoConstructor]` reduces boilerplate
- ✅ Compile-time safety - Refactors update all usages

#### Example Comparison

```csharp
// C# Event (minimal boilerplate)
public event Action<int> OnDamage;
OnDamage?.Invoke(5);

// DxMessaging (more upfront definition)
[DxBroadcastMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct TookDamage { public readonly int amount; }

var msg = new TookDamage(5);
msg.EmitGameObjectBroadcast(gameObject);
```

**Verdict:** For 1-3 simple events, C# events win on brevity. For 10+ events with complex flows, DxMessaging's structure pays dividends.

### Performance

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Absolute minimal overhead - Raw C# events/delegates are faster (~10ns per call)
- ❌ Zero abstraction cost - Direct calls can be inlined by the compiler
- ❌ Simplicity in profiler - One extra layer in call stack

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Zero-allocation struct messages - No GC pressure from boxing
- ✅ Predictable performance - No hidden allocations from lambdas
- ✅ Scalable diagnostics - Built-in profiling/logging without custom instrumentation

#### Hard Numbers

- C# event invoke: ~50ns baseline
- DxMessaging handler: ~60ns (~10ns overhead)
- Memory: Zero allocations for struct messages

**Verdict:** For UI, gameplay events, scene management → DxMessaging overhead is negligible. For ECS with millions of events/frame → stick with raw delegates or native code.

### Flexibility

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Return values - DxMessaging is fire-and-forget (no synchronous responses)
- ❌ Out parameters - Can't use `out` or `ref` for bidirectional communication
- ❌ Dynamic subscriptions - Can't easily pass lambdas inline

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Interception - Validate/transform messages before handlers
- ✅ Post-processing - Analytics/logging without polluting handlers
- ✅ Priority control - Explicit execution order
- ✅ Context - Always know who sent/received

#### When Limitations Hurt

```csharp
// C# events can return values (DxMessaging can't)
public delegate bool DamageValidator(int amount);
public event DamageValidator OnValidateDamage;

if (OnValidateDamage?.Invoke(damage) == true) {
    // Allowed
}

// DxMessaging workaround: Use interceptors or separate query pattern
```

**Verdict:** If you need synchronous request/response, C# delegates/events or direct method calls are better. DxMessaging excels at notifications and commands.

### Debuggability

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Simplicity - Stack traces show message bus internals
- ❌ Step-through - Can't F11 directly from emit to handler (need breakpoints)

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Message history - See last N messages in Inspector
- ✅ Registration view - Know exactly who's listening
- ✅ Global observability - Track all messages without instrumenting code
- ✅ Filtering - Intercept messages for debugging without changing code

#### Example: Finding Who Fired a Message

```csharp
// C# events: Set breakpoint on every possible Invoke(), or add logging everywhere
OnDamage?.Invoke(5); // Where did this come from??

// DxMessaging: Check Inspector message history or add global logger
_ = debugToken.RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource<TookDamage>(
    (src, msg) => Debug.Log($"Damage from {src}: {msg.amount}")
);
```

**Verdict:** Initial debugging is slightly harder (extra layer), but systemic debugging is MUCH easier (observability tools).

### Coupling and Architecture

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Quick hacks - Can't just `GetComponent<T>().DoThing()` anymore
- ❌ Direct inspector wiring - Can't drag-and-drop references to emit messages

#### What You Gain

- ✅ True decoupling - Systems don't know about each other
- ✅ Testability - Easy to isolate with local buses
- ✅ Refactorability - Move/rename components without breaking wiring

#### Impact on Architecture

Before (tight coupling):

```text
UI → References 15 systems
System A → References System B, C, D
Every change ripples through dependencies
```

After (loose coupling):

```text
All systems → Emit messages
All systems → Listen to messages
Add/remove systems without affecting others
```

**Verdict:** If your project is <5k lines, tight coupling is manageable. For larger projects, DxMessaging's decoupling is essential for sanity.

### Testing

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Simplicity - Can't just mock an event subscription

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Isolation - Local buses per test, zero global state
- ✅ Observability - Count messages, inspect payloads easily
- ✅ Determinism - Priority-based ordering eliminates flakiness

##### Example

```csharp
// Test with isolated bus
[Test]
public void TestAchievementSystem() {
    var testBus = new MessageBus();
    var token = MessageRegistrationToken.Create(achievementHandler, testBus);

    var msg = new EnemyKilled("Boss", 10);
    msg.EmitGameObjectBroadcast(enemy, testBus);

    Assert.IsTrue(achievementSystem.Unlocked("BossSlayer"));
}
```

**Verdict:** DxMessaging makes integration testing easier, unit testing slightly more verbose.

- **DI-first architecture:** MessagePipe or Zenject Signals win

## When Each Approach ACTUALLY Wins

### DxMessaging Wins When

- ✅ Unity-first projects (not cross-platform .NET)
- ✅ 10+ systems that communicate
- ✅ You need observability (debugging complex flows)
- ✅ Memory leaks are a pain point
- ✅ Cross-team development (clear contracts)
- ✅ Long-term maintenance (years, not weeks)
- ✅ GameObject/Component targeting needed
- ✅ Execution order control essential (priorities)

- ✅ Small, stable scope (5-10 events max)
- ✅ Team is C# experts, Unity beginners

### UnityEvents Win When

- ✅ Designers need to wire logic without code
- ✅ Rapid prototyping with prefabs
- ✅ Very simple games (mobile casual, hyper-casual)

### Static Event Bus Wins When

- ✅ You've already built one and it works
- ✅ Very simple use cases (just need globals)

## Cost-Benefit Summary

### Costs

1. Learning curve (~1-2 days to feel comfortable)
1. More upfront code (message definitions)
1. Slightly slower than raw C# events (~10ns/call)
1. Can't return values (fire-and-forget only)

### Benefits

1. Zero memory leaks (automatic lifecycle)
1. Full decoupling (systems don't reference each other)
1. Observability (Inspector diagnostics, message history)
1. Predictable ordering (priority-based execution)
1. Interception/validation (before handlers run)
1. Testability (isolated buses)

**Break-even point:** Usually around 10-20 hours into a project, when event management becomes painful.

## Making the Decision (Be Honest With Yourself)

### Answer these questions honestly

### 1. Project Lifespan?

- **<1 week (game jam):** Skip DxMessaging → Use C# events or direct calls
- **1-4 weeks (prototype):** Maybe → If you plan to continue, use DxMessaging
- **1+ months (real project):** Yes → DxMessaging will save you time
- **6+ months (production):** Absolutely → You'll thank yourself later

### 2. Team Size?

- **Solo dev:** Optional → Depends on project complexity
- **2-3 devs:** Valuable → Reduces communication overhead
- **4+ devs:** Highly recommended → Clear contracts between systems
- **Remote/distributed team:** Essential → Explicit message contracts prevent miscommunication

### 3. Codebase Size?

- **<1k lines:** Skip it → Direct method calls are fine
- **1k-5k lines:** Consider it → If you're growing fast
- **5k-20k lines:** Recommended → Coupling becomes painful
- **20k+ lines:** Absolutely → Refactoring without it is a nightmare

### 4. How Many Systems Need to Communicate?

- **1-2 systems:** Skip → Just call methods directly
- **3-5 systems:** Consider → If they don't share references
- **6-10 systems:** Recommended → Coupling becomes unmanageable
- **10+ systems:** Essential → You're drowning in SerializeFields

### 5. Have You Had Memory Leaks From Forgotten Unsubscribes?

- **Never:** Lucky you! Optional
- **Once or twice:** Consider it → Prevention is cheaper than debugging
- **Multiple times:** Absolutely → Stop wasting time on this
- **Currently debugging one:** Drop everything and adopt DxMessaging now

### 6. How Often Do You Debug "What Fired When?"

- **Never:** You're either lying or working on tiny projects
- **Rarely:** Optional, but would help
- **Monthly:** Recommended → Inspector diagnostics will save hours
- **Weekly:** Absolutely → You're wasting too much time

### Quick Decision Matrix

```text
Game Jam         → C# Events (speed over safety)
Prototype        → DxMessaging IF continuing, else C# Events
Production       → DxMessaging (unless <1k lines)
Legacy codebase  → Migrate gradually (see Migration Guide)
```

### The Real Question

#### "Will this project still exist in 3 months?"

- **No:** C# events are fine
- **Yes:** Use DxMessaging

##### "Will anyone else work on this code?"

- **No:** C# events might be okay
- **Yes:** Use DxMessaging (future you counts as "someone else")

### Rule of Thumb

If you're reading this and thinking:

- **"I've experienced these pain points"** → DxMessaging will help
- **"This seems like overkill"** → You probably don't need it yet
- **"I need this yesterday"** → Welcome home 🚀

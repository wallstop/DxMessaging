## Unity Messaging Frameworks

This section compares DxMessaging with other popular Unity messaging/eventing libraries. Each offers different approaches to solving communication and decoupling problems in Unity.

### Quick Summary: Which Framework to Choose?

#### TL;DR Decision Tree

```text
Need absolute simplest pub/sub setup (zero boilerplate)?
  → Use UniRx MessageBroker (publish/receive in 2 lines)

Need complex event stream transformations (debounce, throttle, combine)?
  → Use UniRx (reactive programming paradigm)

Already using Dependency Injection (Zenject, VContainer)?
  → Use MessagePipe (DI-first, best performance) or Zenject Signals (if on Zenject)

Need Unity-specific features (GameObject targeting, Inspector debugging, global observers)?
  → Use DxMessaging (Unity-first design)

Want plug-and-play with zero dependencies?
  → Use DxMessaging (no setup required)

Maximum raw throughput is THE priority?
  → Use MessagePipe (highest ops/sec in benchmarks)

Need message validation, interception, or ordered execution?
  → Use DxMessaging (interceptor pipeline, priority-based ordering)

Simple pub/sub with automatic lifecycle management and debugging?
  → Use DxMessaging (automatic cleanup, priorities, validation, Inspector)
```

##### One-Line Summary for Each

- **DxMessaging:** Unity-first pub/sub with automatic lifecycle, global observers, interceptors, priorities, and Inspector debugging
- **UniRx:** Reactive programming with LINQ-style stream operators for complex event transformations
- **MessagePipe:** DI-first, highest throughput for high-frequency messaging in DI architectures
- **Zenject Signals:** Decoupled messaging integrated with Zenject dependency injection

---

### UniRx (Reactive Extensions for Unity)

**What It Is:** A reactive programming library that treats events as observable streams. Based on .NET Reactive Extensions (Rx), reimplemented for Unity with IL2CPP compatibility.

**Core Philosophy:** Everything is a stream that can be observed, filtered, combined, and transformed using LINQ-style operators.

#### Key Features

- **Stream-based programming:** Transform events into observable sequences
- **LINQ operators:** `Where`, `Select`, `Merge`, `CombineLatest`, `Buffer`, etc.
- **Async operations:** Convert coroutines to observables with cancellation support
- **Multithreading:** Thread-safe operations with main thread synchronization
- **Time operators:** Frame-based and time-based event handling
- **UI integration:** Observable extensions for Unity UI events

#### Code Example

##### Simple MessageBroker Setup (Pub/Sub)

```csharp
using UniRx;
using UnityEngine;

public struct EnemySpawned
{
    public int EnemyId;
    public Vector3 Position;
}

// Publisher - extremely simple, no setup required
public class EnemySpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    void SpawnEnemy(int id)
    {
        MessageBroker.Default.Publish(new EnemySpawned
        {
            EnemyId = id,
            Position = transform.position
        });
    }
}

// Subscriber - also extremely simple
public class AchievementSystem : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        MessageBroker.Default.Receive<EnemySpawned>()
            .Subscribe(msg => Debug.Log($"Enemy {msg.EnemyId} spawned!"))
            .AddTo(this); // Automatic cleanup on destroy
    }
}
```

###### Advanced Stream Transformations (Reactive Programming)

```csharp
// Double-click detection using reactive operators
Observable.EveryUpdate()
    .Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
    .Buffer(Observable.Timer(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(250)))
    .Where(xs => xs.Count >= 2)
    .Subscribe(_ => Debug.Log("Double Click!"));

// Combine multiple input streams
var leftClick = Observable.EveryUpdate().Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0));
var rightClick = Observable.EveryUpdate().Where(_ => Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1));
leftClick.Merge(rightClick).Subscribe(_ => Debug.Log("Any click!"));
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Complex event streams:** Chain, filter, combine, and transform events elegantly
- ✅ **Async operations:** Better async/await alternative with cancellation
- ✅ **Temporal logic:** Time-based operations (throttle, debounce, sample)
- ✅ **UI reactivity:** Bind UI elements to data streams reactively
- ✅ **Memory management:** Disposable subscriptions prevent leaks

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ⚠️ **Simple pub/sub:** MessageBroker handles this well, but using reactive operators for simple scenarios is overkill
- ❌ **Execution order control:** No built-in priority system for handler ordering
- ❌ **Message validation/interception:** No pre-processing pipeline to validate or transform messages before handlers
- ❌ **Unity Inspector debugging:** No Inspector integration to visualize message flow
- ❌ **GameObject/Component targeting:** Not designed for Unity-specific targeting patterns
- ❌ **Global message observation:** Cannot easily listen to all instances of a message type across different sources

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Allocations:** Can allocate on subscription/disposal; stream operators may allocate
- **Overhead:** Higher than simple events due to observable infrastructure
- **Use case:** Best for complex event transformations; overhead justified by functionality

#### Learning Curve

- **Simple MessageBroker (basic pub/sub):** Very easy - just `Publish()` and `Receive()`, similar to events
- **Advanced stream operators:** Steep - requires understanding reactive programming paradigm
- **Mental model shift:** For complex features, must think in streams, not events
- **Documentation:** Extensive examples, but reactive concepts take time to master
- **Estimated learning time:** 15 minutes for MessageBroker; 1-2 weeks for reactive stream mastery

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very easy) - MessageBroker pub/sub is intuitive and straightforward
- ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate to difficult) - Advanced reactive operators require learning
- Stream operator code is concise but requires understanding of reactive patterns
- Hard to debug complex observable chains without Rx knowledge
- For advanced features: Team buy-in essential; not intuitive for traditional event-driven developers

#### When UniRx Wins

- ✅ Simple pub/sub with minimal setup (MessageBroker is extremely easy)
- ✅ Complex event transformations (e.g., double-click, gesture detection)
- ✅ Combining multiple input sources
- ✅ Time-based logic (debounce, throttle, sample)
- ✅ UI data binding with reactive updates
- ✅ Teams familiar with reactive programming

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ Need Unity-specific features (GameObject targeting, lifecycle management)
- ✅ Execution order matters (priority-based ordering)
- ✅ Message validation/interception needed (interceptor pipeline)
- ✅ Inspector debugging required (message history, registration view)
- ✅ Direct GameObject/Component targeting
- ✅ Global message observation (listen to all instances of a message type)
- ✅ Late-stage processing (post-processors after all handlers)
- ✅ Automatic lifecycle management (zero memory leaks)
- ✅ Teams unfamiliar with reactive programming (and don't need reactive features)

### MessagePipe (High-Performance Messaging)

**What It Is:** A high-performance, DI-first messaging library by Cysharp (creators of UniTask). Designed for in-memory and distributed messaging with zero-allocation focus.

**Core Philosophy:** Maximum performance with dependency injection integration. Support all messaging patterns with a unified, generic interface.

#### Key Features

- **Multiple patterns:** Pub/Sub, Request/Response, Mediator patterns
- **Sync and async:** Full async/await support with configurable strategies (sequential/parallel)
- **Keyed messaging:** Type-based or key-based message routing
- **DI-first design:** Deep integration with dependency injection containers
- **Filters:** Pre/post execution customization (similar to interceptors)
- **Zero allocation:** Struct messages with zero GC per publish
- **Roslyn analyzer:** Detects subscription leaks at compile-time
- **Global and scoped:** Support for global message bus or scoped instances

#### Code Example

```csharp
// Using MessagePipe with DI
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private IPublisher<EnemySpawned> _publisher;
    private IDisposable _subscription;

    void Start()
    {
        // Injected via DI container
        _publisher = GlobalMessagePipe.GetPublisher<EnemySpawned>();
        var subscriber = GlobalMessagePipe.GetSubscriber<EnemySpawned>();

        _subscription = subscriber.Subscribe(msg =>
        {
            Debug.Log($"Enemy spawned: {msg.EnemyId}");
        });
    }

    void SpawnEnemy(int id)
    {
        _publisher.Publish(new EnemySpawned { EnemyId = id });
    }

    void OnDestroy() => _subscription?.Dispose();
}

// Async handler with filters
public class AchievementSystem
{
    public AchievementSystem(IAsyncSubscriber<EnemyKilled> subscriber)
    {
        subscriber.Subscribe(async (msg, cancellationToken) =>
        {
            await SaveAchievementAsync(msg.EnemyType);
        });
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Performance:** 78x faster than Prism EventAggregator, zero allocations
- ✅ **DI integration:** First-class support for dependency injection
- ✅ **Async messaging:** Native async/await without blocking
- ✅ **Leak detection:** Analyzer catches forgotten subscriptions at compile-time
- ✅ **Flexibility:** Keyed, keyless, buffered, request/response patterns
- ✅ **Cross-platform:** Works in Unity, .NET, Blazor, etc.

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **Unity-specific integration:** No built-in Unity MonoBehaviour lifecycle management or GameObject targeting
- ❌ **Inspector debugging:** No visual debugging or message history in Unity Inspector
- ❌ **Execution order control:** No priority system (handlers execute in subscription order)
- ❌ **Setup complexity:** Requires DI container configuration (VContainer/Zenject setup needed)
- ❌ **Global message observation:** No built-in way to listen to all instances of a message across different keys/sources
- ❌ **Standalone use:** Designed for DI-first architecture (less suitable for non-DI projects)

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Best-in-class:** Claims 78x faster than Prism, faster than C# events in some scenarios
- **Zero allocation:** Struct-based messages with no GC per publish
- **Benchmark data:** See performance section above for actual numbers
- **Use case:** Optimized for high-frequency messaging (thousands/frame)

#### Learning Curve

- **Moderate:** Requires understanding of dependency injection
- **DI knowledge:** Must be comfortable with service provider pattern
- **Generic interfaces:** Multiple generic types can be confusing initially
- **Estimated learning time:** 2-3 days with DI experience; 1 week without

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)
- Clean, generic interfaces once you understand DI
- Code is straightforward for developers familiar with DI patterns
- Harder for teams without DI experience

#### When MessagePipe Wins

- ✅ Performance-critical applications (high message throughput)
- ✅ Projects already using DI (VContainer, Zenject, etc.)
- ✅ Cross-platform .NET projects (not Unity-only)
- ✅ Need async messaging with cancellation
- ✅ Large-scale projects with DI architecture
- ✅ Teams experienced with DI patterns

#### When DxMessaging Wins

### Zenject Signals (DI-Based Messaging)

**What It Is:** The built-in messaging system for Zenject (Extenject), a dependency injection framework for Unity. Signals are an optional extension that provides decoupled communication.

**Core Philosophy:** Loosely coupled messaging integrated with dependency injection. Reduce direct dependencies between classes while maintaining testability.

#### Key Features

- **DI-integrated:** Signals declared and resolved via Zenject container
- **Typed signals:** Strongly-typed signal classes with parameters
- **Synchronous and async:** Sync (RunSync) and async (RunAsync) execution modes
- **Subscription modes:** Require, optional, or optional-with-warning subscribers
- **Installer-based setup:** Declare signals in installers for container binding
- **Multiple subscription methods:** Direct binding, SignalBus subscription, stream-based (with UniRx)
- **Testable:** Easy to mock and test with dependency injection

#### Code Example

```csharp
// 1. Define signal
public class EnemyKilledSignal
{
    public string EnemyType;
    public int Score;
}

// 2. Install and declare in installer
public class GameInstaller : MonoInstaller
{
    public override void InstallBindings()
    {
        SignalBusInstaller.Install(Container);
        Container.DeclareSignal<EnemyKilledSignal>();
        Container.BindSignal<EnemyKilledSignal>()
            .ToMethod<AchievementSystem>(x => x.OnEnemyKilled)
            .FromResolve();
    }
}

// 3. Fire signal
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Inject] private SignalBus _signalBus;

    void Die()
    {
        _signalBus.Fire(new EnemyKilledSignal
        {
            EnemyType = "Orc",
            Score = 100
        });
    }
}

// 4. Subscribe to signal
public class AchievementSystem
{
    [Inject] private SignalBus _signalBus;

    public void Initialize()
    {
        _signalBus.Subscribe<EnemyKilledSignal>(OnEnemyKilled);
    }

    void OnEnemyKilled(EnemyKilledSignal signal)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Killed {signal.EnemyType} for {signal.Score} points!");
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Decoupling:** Classes communicate without direct references
- ✅ **DI integration:** Seamless with Zenject dependency injection
- ✅ **Testability:** Easy to mock SignalBus in tests
- ✅ **Type safety:** Strongly-typed signal classes
- ✅ **Subscriber validation:** Can enforce required subscribers
- ✅ **Async support:** Fire signals synchronously or asynchronously

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **Zenject dependency:** Must use Zenject/Extenject framework; not standalone
- ❌ **Performance overhead:** Higher than lightweight messaging (DI resolution cost)
- ❌ **Execution order control:** No priority system for handler ordering
- ❌ **Inspector debugging:** No visual message history or flow visualization
- ❌ **Allocations:** Signal parameters can cause allocations depending on usage
- ❌ **Validation pipeline:** No built-in interceptor or pre-processing stage
- ❌ **Global observation:** Cannot easily listen to all signal fires across the system
- ❌ **Post-processing:** No dedicated after-handler stage for analytics/logging

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Overhead:** Higher than lightweight messaging (DI resolution + boxing)
- **Allocations:** Signal parameters can cause allocations (depends on implementation)
- **Benchmark data:** See performance section above for actual numbers
- **Use case:** Performance trade-off for testability and DI benefits

#### Learning Curve

- **Moderate to steep:** Requires understanding Zenject dependency injection
- **Zenject knowledge:** Must learn Zenject before signals
- **Setup overhead:** Installers, bindings, container configuration
- **Estimated learning time:** 1 week for Zenject + signals together

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐ (Moderate)
- Clear once you understand Zenject
- Signal concept is straightforward
- Setup (installers, bindings) adds complexity

#### When Zenject Signals Win

- ✅ Already using Zenject for dependency injection
- ✅ Testability is critical (DI makes mocking easy)
- ✅ Need subscriber validation (ensure handlers exist)
- ✅ Team experienced with Zenject
- ✅ Want DI-managed lifecycle

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ Not using Zenject/Extenject (or prefer standalone solution)
- ✅ Performance critical (lower overhead than DI-based signals)
- ✅ Execution order control needed (priority-based handlers)
- ✅ Inspector debugging required (message history visualization)
- ✅ Message validation/interception needed (interceptor pipeline)
- ✅ Global message observation needed (listen to all signal fires)
- ✅ Post-processing stage needed (analytics after handlers)
- ✅ Zero-allocation messaging essential (struct-based)
- ✅ GameObject/Component targeting needed (Unity-specific patterns)
- ✅ Plug-and-play simplicity preferred over DI setup

## Traditional Approaches

### Standard C# Events/Actions

**What It Is:** C#'s built-in event and delegate system. The default way to handle callbacks and notifications in .NET and Unity.

**Core Philosophy:** Direct, type-safe callbacks between objects. Simple, familiar, and built into the language.

#### Key Features

- **Language-native:** Built into C#, no dependencies
- **Type-safe:** Compile-time checking of event signatures
- **Return values:** Events can return values and use `out` parameters
- **Inline lambdas:** Subscribe with anonymous functions
- **Multicast:** Multiple subscribers per event
- **Fast:** Direct method invocation with minimal overhead

#### Code Example

```csharp
// Define and use C# events
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public event Action<int> OnScoreChanged;

    public void AddScore(int points)
    {
        OnScoreChanged?.Invoke(points);
    }
}

public class UI : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private GameManager gameManager;

    void OnEnable()
    {
        gameManager.OnScoreChanged += UpdateScore;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        gameManager.OnScoreChanged -= UpdateScore;
    }

    void UpdateScore(int points)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Score: {points}");
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Simple callbacks:** Straightforward notification pattern
- ✅ **Type safety:** Compile-time checking prevents errors
- ✅ **Return values:** Can get feedback from event handlers
- ✅ **Performance:** Minimal overhead, direct invocation
- ✅ **Familiarity:** Every C# developer knows events
- ✅ **No dependencies:** Built into the language

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **Memory leaks:** Forgetting to unsubscribe causes leaks
- ❌ **Tight coupling:** Subscribers need direct references to event sources
- ❌ **Execution order:** Undefined handler invocation order
- ❌ **Lifecycle management:** Manual subscribe/unsubscribe in OnEnable/OnDisable
- ❌ **Debugging:** No visibility into who's subscribed or when events fire
- ❌ **Validation/interception:** No pipeline to modify or validate before handlers
- ❌ **Global observation:** Cannot listen to all events across the system

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Fastest option:** Direct method invocation (~50ns per call)
- **Zero allocation:** No GC pressure for basic events
- **Inline-able:** JIT can optimize simple event calls
- **Use case:** Best raw performance for simple notifications

#### Learning Curve

- **Zero for C# developers:** Standard language feature
- **Immediate productivity:** No new concepts to learn
- **Estimated learning time:** Already know it

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very easy)
- Familiar to all C# developers
- Straightforward mental model
- Easy to debug with breakpoints

#### When C# Events Win

- ✅ Small, stable scope (5-10 events max)
- ✅ Need return values or `out` parameters
- ✅ Writing a library (DxMessaging is Unity-specific)
- ✅ Simple, local communication within a class or module
- ✅ Team is C# experts, Unity beginners
- ✅ Performance is absolutely critical (lowest overhead)
- ✅ Quick prototypes or game jams

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ Memory leaks are a problem (automatic lifecycle management)
- ✅ Need decoupling (systems don't reference each other)
- ✅ Execution order matters (priority-based handlers)
- ✅ Debugging "what fired when" (Inspector message history)
- ✅ Message validation/interception needed (interceptor pipeline)
- ✅ Global observation needed (listen to all message instances)
- ✅ Cross-system communication (10+ systems)
- ✅ Long-term maintenance (months/years)
- ✅ GameObject/Component targeting needed
- ✅ Post-processing stage needed (analytics after handlers)

### UnityEvents (Inspector Wiring)

**What It Is:** Unity's serializable event system that allows wiring callbacks in the Inspector. Designed for designer-friendly event hookups without code.

**Core Philosophy:** Visual, Inspector-based event connections. Enable non-programmers to wire game logic through the editor.

#### Key Features

- **Inspector wiring:** Drag-and-drop connections in Unity Inspector
- **Serializable:** Events saved with scenes and prefabs
- **Designer-friendly:** Non-programmers can wire logic
- **Persistent references:** Connections survive across sessions
- **Dynamic parameters:** Pass values from Inspector to callbacks
- **No code required:** Can wire entire behaviors without scripting

#### Code Example

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;

public class Button : MonoBehaviour
{
    public UnityEvent onClick;

    void OnMouseDown()
    {
        onClick?.Invoke();
    }
}

public class UI : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void ShowMenu()
    {
        Debug.Log("Menu shown");
    }

    public void HideMenu()
    {
        Debug.Log("Menu hidden");
    }
}

// In Inspector: Drag UI component to Button's onClick event
// Select ShowMenu from dropdown
// No additional code needed
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Visual wiring:** See connections in Inspector
- ✅ **No code required:** Designers can hook up events
- ✅ **Persistence:** Connections saved with scenes/prefabs
- ✅ **Rapid prototyping:** Quick iteration without scripting
- ✅ **Prefab workflows:** Events work across prefab instances

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **Hidden dependencies:** Connections invisible in code, hard to find during refactoring
- ❌ **Brittle at scale:** Renaming methods breaks wiring, no compile-time safety
- ❌ **Execution order:** Undefined call order for multiple subscribers
- ❌ **No validation:** No way to validate or intercept before invocation
- ❌ **Performance:** Slower than C# events due to reflection and boxing
- ❌ **Debugging:** Hard to trace "who called what" at runtime
- ❌ **Merge conflicts:** Inspector changes cause git conflicts
- ❌ **Refactoring pain:** Renaming/moving methods silently breaks connections

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Slow compared to alternatives:** Reflection overhead, boxing for value types
- **Allocations:** Parameters boxed as objects, causes GC pressure
- **Use case:** Acceptable for UI and low-frequency events, avoid for high-frequency gameplay

#### Learning Curve

- **Very easy:** Point-and-click in Inspector
- **No coding knowledge needed:** Accessible to designers
- **Estimated learning time:** 5-10 minutes

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Easy for wiring, hard for debugging)
- Simple to connect in Inspector
- Difficult to understand flow when reading code
- Hard to track down at scale (where is this method called from?)

#### When UnityEvents Win

- ✅ Designers need to wire logic without code
- ✅ Rapid prototyping with prefabs
- ✅ Very simple games (mobile casual, hyper-casual)
- ✅ UI interactions with minimal logic
- ✅ Small projects (<5 scripts)
- ✅ One-off connections that rarely change

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ Code-first development (programmers prefer code visibility)
- ✅ Refactoring frequently (compile-time safety)
- ✅ Execution order matters (priority-based handlers)
- ✅ Need validation/interception (interceptor pipeline)
- ✅ Performance-sensitive (zero allocation required)
- ✅ Debugging observability (message history)
- ✅ Cross-system communication (10+ components)
- ✅ Team collaboration (merge-friendly code over Inspector)
- ✅ Long-term maintenance (find usages, refactor safely)

| **Testability**          | ⭐⭐ Scene setup       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Local buses |
| **Decoupling**           | ⭐⭐ Hidden refs       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent   |
| **Refactoring Safety**   | ❌ Silent breakage     | ✅ Compile-time errors |
| **Code Visibility**      | ❌ Hidden in Inspector | ✅ Explicit in code    |

**Bottom Line:** UnityEvents are great for simple Inspector-based wiring and designer workflows. DxMessaging is better for code-first development, refactoring safety, and complex messaging needs.

### Unity SendMessage

**What It Is:** Unity's legacy reflection-based message system. Calls methods by name on GameObjects and their components.

**Core Philosophy:** String-based, reflection-driven communication. Designed for simplicity and GameObject hierarchy traversal.

#### Key Features

- **String-based:** Call methods by name without references
- **Hierarchy traversal:** SendMessageUpwards, BroadcastMessage for parent/child searching
- **No dependencies:** Built into Unity GameObject
- **Simple API:** One-line method calls
- **GameObject-centric:** Works with Unity's component model
- **Optional receivers:** Methods don't need to exist (SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver)

#### Code Example

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Took {amount} damage");
    }
}

public class Weapon : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Attack(GameObject target)
    {
        // Call TakeDamage on target GameObject
        target.SendMessage("TakeDamage", 10);
    }

    void AttackUpwards()
    {
        // Call on this GameObject and all parents
        SendMessageUpwards("TakeDamage", 5, SendMessageOptions.DontRequireReceiver);
    }

    void AttackChildren()
    {
        // Call on this GameObject and all children
        BroadcastMessage("TakeDamage", 3);
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **No references needed:** Call methods without GetComponent
- ✅ **Hierarchy traversal:** Easy parent/child communication
- ✅ **Simple API:** One-line method invocation
- ✅ **Optional receivers:** Can call non-existent methods safely
- ✅ **Built-in:** No setup or dependencies

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **No type safety:** String-based, typos cause silent failures
- ❌ **Slow performance:** Reflection overhead on every call
- ❌ **Limited parameters:** Only 0 or 1 parameter supported
- ❌ **Boxing allocations:** Value types boxed to object, causes GC
- ❌ **Hard to debug:** No compile-time checking, no IDE "Find Usages"
- ❌ **Refactoring nightmare:** Renaming methods breaks string references
- ❌ **No validation:** No way to validate or intercept messages
- ❌ **Execution order:** Undefined call order for multiple receivers

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Very slow:** Reflection overhead much worse than events or messaging systems
- **Allocations:** Boxing value type parameters causes GC pressure
- **Use case:** Legacy code only; avoid for new development

#### Learning Curve

- **Very easy:** Simple one-line API
- **Immediate productivity:** No setup required
- **Estimated learning time:** 5 minutes

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐ (Simple to use, hard to maintain)
- Easy to write initially
- Difficult to track method calls (no Find Usages)
- Refactoring breaks string references silently

#### When Unity SendMessage Wins

- ✅ Legacy code that already uses it
- ✅ Quick prototypes (throwaway code)
- ✅ Simple tutorials or learning examples
- ✅ Calling optional methods that may not exist

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ Type safety required (compile-time checking)
- ✅ Performance matters (zero allocation, no reflection)
- ✅ Multiple parameters needed (struct fields)
- ✅ Refactoring frequently (find usages, rename safely)
- ✅ Debugging observability (message history)
- ✅ Execution order control (priority-based handlers)
- ✅ Message validation/interception (interceptor pipeline)
- ✅ Production code (maintainability over simplicity)
- ✅ Modern projects (avoid legacy patterns)

#### Direct Comparison

| Aspect                   | Unity SendMessage         | DxMessaging                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Primary Use Case**     | Legacy GameObject calls   | Pub/sub messaging            |
| **Unity Compatibility**  | ✅ Built into Unity       | ✅ Built for Unity           |
| **Dependencies**         | ✅ None (Unity)           | ✅ Standalone                |
| **Performance**          | Very slow (reflection)    | ~60ns/call                   |

| **Setup Complexity**     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ None           | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate              |
| **DI Integration**       | ❌ No                     | ⚠️ Optional                  |
| **Async/Await**          | ❌ No                     | ⚠️ Manual                    |
| **Type Safety**          | ❌ String-based           | ✅ Strong                    |
| **Lifecycle Management** | ❌ None                   | ✅ Automatic                 |
| **Execution Order**      | ❌ Undefined              | ✅ Priority-based            |
| **GameObject Targeting** | ✅ Hierarchy traversal    | ✅ Built-in (ID-based)       |
| **Unity Integration**    | ⭐⭐ Legacy API           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Deep              |
| **Inspector Debugging**  | ❌ No                     | ✅ History + stats           |
| **Interceptors**         | ❌ Not built-in           | ✅ Full pipeline             |
| **Global Observers**     | ❌ Not possible           | ✅ Listen to all             |
| **Post-Processing**      | ❌ Not built-in           | ✅ Dedicated stage           |
| **Testability**          | ⭐⭐ Requires GameObjects | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Local buses       |
| **Decoupling**           | ⭐⭐ String-based         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent         |
| **Refactoring Safety**   | ❌ Silent breakage        | ✅ Compile-time errors       |
| **Parameters**           | ⚠️ 0 or 1 only            | ✅ Unlimited (struct fields) |

**Bottom Line:** SendMessage is legacy Unity API. Use only for maintaining old code. DxMessaging provides all the same capabilities with type safety, performance, and modern tooling.

**Migration Path:** DxMessaging provides `ReflexiveMessage` to bridge legacy SendMessage behavior:

```csharp
using DxMessaging.Core;
using DxMessaging.Core.Messages;

// Legacy SendMessage equivalent
InstanceId target = gameObject;
var msg = new ReflexiveMessage("OnHit", ReflexiveSendMode.Upwards, 10);
MessageHandler.MessageBus.TargetedBroadcast(ref target, ref msg);

// Prefer typed messages for new code:
// - Multiple parameters via struct fields
// - By-ref handlers avoid boxing
// - Compile-time safety
```

### Global Event Bus Singletons

**What It Is:** A static/singleton class that centralizes all events in one global location. Common pattern for decoupling without dependency injection.

**Core Philosophy:** Central event hub accessible from anywhere. Simplify communication through a single global entry point.

#### Key Features

- **Global access:** Static class available everywhere
- **No references needed:** No GetComponent or serialized fields
- **Simple pattern:** Easy to understand and implement
- **Decoupling:** Publishers and subscribers don't know about each other
- **Flexibility:** Can add events without changing existing code

#### Code Example

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;

public static class EventHub
{
    public static event Action<int> OnDamage;
    public static event Action<string> OnEnemyKilled;
    public static event Action OnGameOver;

    public static void RaiseDamage(int amount) => OnDamage?.Invoke(amount);
    public static void RaiseEnemyKilled(string enemyType) => OnEnemyKilled?.Invoke(enemyType);
    public static void RaiseGameOver() => OnGameOver?.Invoke();
}

// Producer
public class Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Die()
    {
        EventHub.RaiseEnemyKilled("Orc");
    }
}

// Consumer
public class UI : MonoBehaviour
{
    void OnEnable()
    {
        EventHub.OnEnemyKilled += HandleEnemyKilled;
    }

    void OnDisable()
    {
        EventHub.OnEnemyKilled -= HandleEnemyKilled;
    }

    void HandleEnemyKilled(string enemyType)
    {
        Debug.Log($"Enemy killed: {enemyType}");
    }
}
```

#### What Problems It Solves

- ✅ **Global decoupling:** No direct references between systems
- ✅ **Easy to add events:** Just add to static class
- ✅ **Simple pattern:** Straightforward to implement and understand
- ✅ **No setup:** No DI container or framework needed

#### What Problems It Doesn't Solve Well

- ❌ **Memory leaks:** Still manual subscribe/unsubscribe (same as C# events)
- ❌ **Global state:** Everything in one bag, hard to organize at scale
- ❌ **Execution order:** Undefined handler invocation order
- ❌ **Testing difficulty:** Global state makes unit testing hard
- ❌ **Naming conflicts:** All events in same namespace, naming gets messy
- ❌ **No validation:** No way to intercept or validate messages
- ❌ **No observability:** Can't see who's subscribed or message history
- ❌ **Ownership unclear:** Who manages what events?
- ❌ **Lifecycle management:** Manual subscribe/unsubscribe required

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Good performance:** Similar to C# events (static overhead is minimal)
- **Zero allocation:** No GC pressure for basic events
- **Use case:** Acceptable for most scenarios

#### Learning Curve

- **Very easy:** Just a static class with events
- **Immediate productivity:** No new concepts
- **Estimated learning time:** 10 minutes

#### Ease of Understanding

- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Easy initially, hard at scale)
- Simple pattern to grasp
- Becomes messy with 20+ events
- Hard to track ownership and responsibilities

#### When Static Event Bus Wins

- ✅ You've already built one and it works
- ✅ Very simple use cases (just need globals)
- ✅ Small projects (<10 events)
- ✅ No framework dependencies desired
- ✅ Quick prototypes

#### When DxMessaging Wins

- ✅ More than 10-15 events (organization becomes important)
- ✅ Memory leaks are a concern (automatic lifecycle management)
- ✅ Execution order matters (priority-based handlers)
- ✅ Need message validation/interception (interceptor pipeline)
- ✅ Testing is important (local buses for isolation)
- ✅ Observability needed (Inspector debugging, message history)
- ✅ Multiple subsystems (namespacing and organization)
- ✅ GameObject/Component targeting needed
- ✅ Global observation needed (listen to all message instances)
- ✅ Post-processing needed (analytics after handlers)
- ✅ Long-term maintenance (structure prevents chaos)

#### Direct Comparison

| Aspect                   | Static Event Bus      | DxMessaging            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Primary Use Case**     | Global event hub      | Pub/sub messaging      |
| **Unity Compatibility**  | ✅ Works in Unity     | ✅ Built for Unity     |
| **Dependencies**         | ✅ None (custom)      | ✅ Standalone          |
| **Performance**          | ~50ns/call (fast)     | ~60ns/call             |
| **Allocations**          | ✅ Zero (basic)       | ✅ Zero (structs)      |
| **Learning Curve**       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Minimal    | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate        |
| **Setup Complexity**     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Minimal    | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate        |
| **DI Integration**       | ⚠️ Manual             | ⚠️ Optional            |
| **Async/Await**          | ⚠️ Manual             | ⚠️ Manual              |
| **Type Safety**          | ✅ Strong             | ✅ Strong              |
| **Lifecycle Management** | ❌ Manual unsubscribe | ✅ Automatic           |
| **Execution Order**      | ❌ Undefined          | ✅ Priority-based      |
| **GameObject Targeting** | ❌ Not built-in       | ✅ Built-in            |
| **Unity Integration**    | ⭐ None               | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Deep        |
| **Inspector Debugging**  | ❌ No                 | ✅ History + stats     |
| **Interceptors**         | ❌ Not built-in       | ✅ Full pipeline       |
| **Global Observers**     | ❌ Not built-in       | ✅ Listen to all       |
| **Post-Processing**      | ❌ Not built-in       | ✅ Dedicated stage     |
| **Testability**          | ⭐ Hard (global)      | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Local buses |
| **Decoupling**           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent   |
| **Organization**         | ⭐⭐ One big class    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Structured  |

**Bottom Line:** Static event buses solve global access but inherit all the problems of C# events (leaks, undefined order, no observability). DxMessaging provides the same global access with lifecycle safety, structure, and debugging tools.

**Migration Path:** DxMessaging can replace static event buses gradually:

```csharp
// Old static event bus
EventHub.RaiseDamage(5);

// DxMessaging equivalent (global bus)
new TookDamage(5).Emit();

// Or use local buses for subsystems
var combatBus = new MessageBus();
new TookDamage(5).Emit(combatBus);
```

## Honest Trade-offs: What You Give Up, What You Gain

**Let's be real:** DxMessaging isn't free magic. You trade some things for others. Here's the unfiltered truth about what you gain and what you sacrifice.

**Bottom line first:** For game jam prototypes, C# events are faster to write. For anything you'll maintain for months, DxMessaging saves you time and sanity.

### Learning Curve

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ **Immediate productivity** - ~1-2 days to feel comfortable (reading docs, trying examples)
- ❌ **Familiarity** - Your team knows C# events already; DxMessaging is new
- ❌ **"Just works" intuition** - You need to think: "Which message type? What priority?"

**Real talk:** Your first message will take 15 minutes. By the 10th message, you'll be faster than with events.

#### What You Gain

- ✅ **Long-term velocity** - Adding new features doesn't require touching 5 existing systems
- ✅ **Debugging is 10x faster** - Inspector shows "what fired when" instantly
- ✅ **Onboarding is easier** - New devs see explicit message contracts, not hidden event chains

**Example:** Junior dev asks "How does damage work?"

- **C# events:** "Uh, Player has an OnDamaged event, and HealthBar subscribes in line 47, and..."
- **DxMessaging:** "Search for `TookDamage` message, see who emits it and who listens."

##### Verdict

- Game jam (1 week project): Learning curve not worth it → Stick with C# events
- Mid-size game (1+ month): Pays off by week 2
- Large game (6+ months): Essential for sanity

### Boilerplate

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ "One-liners" - C# events can be `public event Action OnClick;` done
- ❌ Quick and dirty - Need to define message struct, attributes, handler registration

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Explicit contracts - Messages are discoverable types, not hidden delegates
- ✅ Auto-generated code - `[DxAutoConstructor]` reduces boilerplate
- ✅ Compile-time safety - Refactors update all usages

#### Example Comparison

```csharp
// C# Event (minimal boilerplate)
public event Action<int> OnDamage;
OnDamage?.Invoke(5);

// DxMessaging (more upfront definition)
[DxBroadcastMessage]
[DxAutoConstructor]
public readonly partial struct TookDamage { public readonly int amount; }

var msg = new TookDamage(5);
msg.EmitGameObjectBroadcast(gameObject);
```

**Verdict:** For 1-3 simple events, C# events win on brevity. For 10+ events with complex flows, DxMessaging's structure pays dividends.

### Performance

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Absolute minimal overhead - Raw C# events/delegates are faster (~10ns per call)
- ❌ Zero abstraction cost - Direct calls can be inlined by the compiler
- ❌ Simplicity in profiler - One extra layer in call stack

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Zero-allocation struct messages - No GC pressure from boxing
- ✅ Predictable performance - No hidden allocations from lambdas
- ✅ Scalable diagnostics - Built-in profiling/logging without custom instrumentation

#### Hard Numbers

- C# event invoke: ~50ns baseline
- DxMessaging handler: ~60ns (~10ns overhead)
- Memory: Zero allocations for struct messages

**Verdict:** For UI, gameplay events, scene management → DxMessaging overhead is negligible. For ECS with millions of events/frame → stick with raw delegates or native code.

### Flexibility

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Return values - DxMessaging is fire-and-forget (no synchronous responses)
- ❌ Out parameters - Can't use `out` or `ref` for bidirectional communication
- ❌ Dynamic subscriptions - Can't easily pass lambdas inline

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Interception - Validate/transform messages before handlers
- ✅ Post-processing - Analytics/logging without polluting handlers
- ✅ Priority control - Explicit execution order
- ✅ Context - Always know who sent/received

#### When Limitations Hurt

```csharp
// C# events can return values (DxMessaging can't)
public delegate bool DamageValidator(int amount);
public event DamageValidator OnValidateDamage;

if (OnValidateDamage?.Invoke(damage) == true) {
    // Allowed
}

// DxMessaging workaround: Use interceptors or separate query pattern
```

**Verdict:** If you need synchronous request/response, C# delegates/events or direct method calls are better. DxMessaging excels at notifications and commands.

### Debuggability

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Simplicity - Stack traces show message bus internals
- ❌ Step-through - Can't F11 directly from emit to handler (need breakpoints)

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Message history - See last N messages in Inspector
- ✅ Registration view - Know exactly who's listening
- ✅ Global observability - Track all messages without instrumenting code
- ✅ Filtering - Intercept messages for debugging without changing code

#### Example: Finding Who Fired a Message

```csharp
// C# events: Set breakpoint on every possible Invoke(), or add logging everywhere
OnDamage?.Invoke(5); // Where did this come from??

// DxMessaging: Check Inspector message history or add global logger
_ = debugToken.RegisterBroadcastWithoutSource<TookDamage>(
    (src, msg) => Debug.Log($"Damage from {src}: {msg.amount}")
);
```

**Verdict:** Initial debugging is slightly harder (extra layer), but systemic debugging is MUCH easier (observability tools).

### Coupling and Architecture

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Quick hacks - Can't just `GetComponent<T>().DoThing()` anymore
- ❌ Direct inspector wiring - Can't drag-and-drop references to emit messages

#### What You Gain

- ✅ True decoupling - Systems don't know about each other
- ✅ Testability - Easy to isolate with local buses
- ✅ Refactorability - Move/rename components without breaking wiring

#### Impact on Architecture

Before (tight coupling):

```text
UI → References 15 systems
System A → References System B, C, D
Every change ripples through dependencies
```

After (loose coupling):

```text
All systems → Emit messages
All systems → Listen to messages
Add/remove systems without affecting others
```

**Verdict:** If your project is <5k lines, tight coupling is manageable. For larger projects, DxMessaging's decoupling is essential for sanity.

### Testing

#### What You Give Up

- ❌ Simplicity - Can't just mock an event subscription

#### What You Gain

- ✅ Isolation - Local buses per test, zero global state
- ✅ Observability - Count messages, inspect payloads easily
- ✅ Determinism - Priority-based ordering eliminates flakiness

##### Example

```csharp
// Test with isolated bus
[Test]
public void TestAchievementSystem() {
    var testBus = new MessageBus();
    var token = MessageRegistrationToken.Create(achievementHandler, testBus);

    var msg = new EnemyKilled("Boss", 10);
    msg.EmitGameObjectBroadcast(enemy, testBus);

    Assert.IsTrue(achievementSystem.Unlocked("BossSlayer"));
}
```

**Verdict:** DxMessaging makes integration testing easier, unit testing slightly more verbose.

- ✅ Very simple use cases (just need globals)

## Cost-Benefit Summary

### Costs

1. Learning curve (~1-2 days to feel comfortable)
1. More upfront code (message definitions)
1. Slightly slower than raw C# events (~10ns/call)
1. Can't return values (fire-and-forget only)

### Benefits

1. Zero memory leaks (automatic lifecycle)
1. Full decoupling (systems don't reference each other)
1. Observability (Inspector diagnostics, message history)
1. Predictable ordering (priority-based execution)
1. Interception/validation (before handlers run)
1. Testability (isolated buses)

**Break-even point:** Usually around 10-20 hours into a project, when event management becomes painful.

## Making the Decision (Be Honest With Yourself)

### Answer these questions honestly

### 1. Project Lifespan?

- **<1 week (game jam):** Skip DxMessaging → Use C# events or direct calls
- **1-4 weeks (prototype):** Maybe → If you plan to continue, use DxMessaging
- **1+ months (real project):** Yes → DxMessaging will save you time
- **6+ months (production):** Absolutely → You'll thank yourself later

### 2. Team Size?

- **Solo dev:** Optional → Depends on project complexity
- **2-3 devs:** Valuable → Reduces communication overhead
- **4+ devs:** Highly recommended → Clear contracts between systems
- **Remote/distributed team:** Essential → Explicit message contracts prevent miscommunication

### 3. Codebase Size?

- **<1k lines:** Skip it → Direct method calls are fine
- **1k-5k lines:** Consider it → If you're growing fast
- **5k-20k lines:** Recommended → Coupling becomes painful
- **20k+ lines:** Absolutely → Refactoring without it is a nightmare

### 4. How Many Systems Need to Communicate?

- **1-2 systems:** Skip → Just call methods directly
- **3-5 systems:** Consider → If they don't share references
- **6-10 systems:** Recommended → Coupling becomes unmanageable
- **10+ systems:** Essential → You're drowning in SerializeFields

### 5. Have You Had Memory Leaks From Forgotten Unsubscribes?

- **Never:** Lucky you! Optional
- **Once or twice:** Consider it → Prevention is cheaper than debugging
- **Multiple times:** Absolutely → Stop wasting time on this
- **Currently debugging one:** Drop everything and adopt DxMessaging now

### 6. How Often Do You Debug "What Fired When?"

- **Never:** You're either lying or working on tiny projects
- **Rarely:** Optional, but would help
- **Monthly:** Recommended → Inspector diagnostics will save hours
- **Weekly:** Absolutely → You're wasting too much time

### Quick Decision Matrix

```text
Game Jam         → C# Events (speed over safety)
Prototype        → DxMessaging IF continuing, else C# Events
Production       → DxMessaging (unless <1k lines)
Legacy codebase  → Migrate gradually (see Migration Guide)
```

### The Real Question

#### "Will this project still exist in 3 months?"

- **No:** C# events are fine
- **Yes:** Use DxMessaging

##### "Will anyone else work on this code?"

- **No:** C# events might be okay
- **Yes:** Use DxMessaging (future you counts as "someone else")

### Rule of Thumb

If you're reading this and thinking:

- **"I've experienced these pain points"** → DxMessaging will help
- **"This seems like overkill"** → You probably don't need it yet
- **"I need this yesterday"** → Welcome home 🚀

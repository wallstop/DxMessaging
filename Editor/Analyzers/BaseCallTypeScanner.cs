    /// surface analyzer warnings. On Bee/csc cache hits — which happen on most domain reloads

    /// though the analyzer ran successfully on the first compile. By contrast, IL reflection over
    /// loaded types is deterministic: the assemblies are in the AppDomain, the methods have IL

    /// <item><description>DXMSG007 — declares the method with the <c>new</c> modifier (IL: name
    /// shadows a base virtual but the descendant method itself is not in an override slot).</description></item>
    /// <item><description>DXMSG009 — declares the method without override or new — same IL shape
    /// as DXMSG007 (both compile to a non-virtual hide-by-sig method). The scanner cannot
    /// distinguish the two perfectly from IL alone, so it conservatively classifies this case as
    /// DXMSG007. The compile-time analyzer is authoritative for the precise ID classification;
    /// the scanner's job is just to make sure the inspector overlay lights up.</description></item>
    /// <item><description>DXMSG010 — overrides correctly (calls base) but an intermediate
    /// ancestor's override in the chain does NOT call base. Walks parent-by-parent and re-runs the
    /// IL check at every link until the chain terminates at <see cref="MessageAwareComponent"/>

/**
 * @fileoverview Tests for validate-docs-out-of-tree-links.js. The validator
 * guards against the failure mode that took down `Validate Documentation
 * Build / Build documentation (strict mode)`: relative links from docs/ that
 * climb above the docs/ tree (for example `../../.github/workflows/...`) are
 * invalid in mkdocs strict mode because mkdocs only resolves links inside
 * the docs/ tree. Such references must use the absolute `https://github.com/.../blob/master/...`
 * URL instead.
 *
 * The validator additionally checks the OTHER half of the linking contract:
 * every self-repo `.../blob/<ref>/<path>` URL must resolve to a real file or
 * directory in the working tree (validated offline -- lychee excludes these
 * URLs because a network check 404s for files added in the same PR before
 * they reach master). Fixtures tagged with `reasonMatch` exercise that path.

/**
 * @fileoverview Repository-wide policy guard that makes the ENTIRE category of
 * "fragile phrase assertion on RAW PowerShell-rendered output" impossible to
 * reintroduce. It covers the direct member-access, tainted-local-variable, and
 * renamed-merge-helper forms, AND the four formerly-residual bypasses that are now
 * CLOSED: an INTERPOLATED-template phrase argument, a phrase stored in a VARIABLE,
 * a STRING-CONCATENATION raw merge in a renamed helper, and a tainted-local raw
 * merge whose initializer spans REAL source newlines (now also via a comma
 * declarator or a paren-wrapped initializer). A small set of intentional residuals
 * remains (a helper returning a BARE single member; a string-less `+` of two raw
 * members; general runtime indirection); see "Residual limits".
 *
 * Background:
 *   When `pwsh -File <script>` lets an unhandled `throw` reach the top of the
 *   script, PowerShell's ConciseView error formatter WORD-WRAPS the message at
 *   the host console width, inserting a `\n     | ` continuation gutter (plus
 *   ANSI color escapes) between words. On the narrower Windows CI runner this
 *   splits an asserted phrase -- e.g. "outside the managed root" became
 *   "...outside the\n     | managed root." -- so a literal `.toContain(...)` on
 *   the raw stdout/stderr found nothing and the test FAILED on Windows only
 *   (it passed on Linux/macOS, where the default width kept the phrase together).
 *   The production message was CORRECT; the assertion was width-dependent.
 *
 *   The fix is scripts/lib/pwsh-output.js's `normalizePwshText`, which strips
 *   ANSI/OSC escapes, rejoins the gutter, and collapses whitespace before the
 *   assertion. This guard ensures every phrase/error substring assertion against
 *   pwsh output in a pwsh-spawning test file goes through that normalizer (or a
 *   recognized wrapper helper), so the regression is loud at pre-push time on
 *   EVERY host, not just Windows.
 *
 *   Policy -- In a test file that SPAWNS pwsh, a phrase assertion (a
 *   `.toContain(<multi-word string literal>)` / `.not.toContain(<multi-word
 *   string literal>)` / `.toMatch(<regex literal>)`) applied to a RAW
 *   pwsh-output receiver is forbidden. A "raw pwsh-output receiver" is either:
 *     (a) a MEMBER-ACCESS on a spawn result that ends in `.stdout` / `.stderr`
 *         (e.g. `result.stdout`, `out.stderr`, `run.stdout`), or a template
 *         literal that merges such members (e.g. `` `${out.stdout}\n${out.stderr}` ``);
 *         OR
 *     (b) a LOCAL VARIABLE bound to such a raw merge in the same file
 *         (`const combined = `${out.stdout}\n${out.stderr}`; ... expect(combined)`).
 *   The receiver is COMPLIANT when it is wrapped in `normalizePwshText(...)`, or
 *   is (or is bound to) a recognized normalizing wrapper helper -- by convention
 *   `combinedText(...)` / `stdoutText(...)`, which this repo defines as
 *   `normalizePwshText`-backed one-liners. A single-word `.toContain("token")`
 *   (no interior whitespace) is NOT a wrappable phrase -- a single token cannot
 *   be split by a space-driven word wrap -- so it is intentionally not flagged.
 *
 *   A SEPARATE rule closes the "renamed helper" door: the receiver check above
 *   recognizes the normalizing wrappers by NAME, so a differently-named helper
 *   whose body rebuilds the raw `${out.stdout}\n${out.stderr}` template merge
 *   WITHOUT `normalizePwshText` would launder the anti-pattern past it. The guard
 *   therefore also forbids DEFINING, in a pwsh-spawning test file, a `return`/
 *   arrow-implicit-return whose value is an un-normalized `.stdout`/`.stderr`
 *   template merge -- the merge is flagged at its definition, independent of how it
 *   is later called (see findRenamedMergeHelpers).
 *
 * How to mutation-test this guard (do this when you touch it):
 *   1. In a consumer test (e.g. unity-ensure-editor-il2cpp-idempotency.test.js),
 *      change `const combined = combinedText(out);` back to
 *      `const combined = `${out.stdout || ""}\n${out.stderr || ""}`;`.
 *      Run this suite -> it must FAIL (tainted-local form). Revert.
 *   2. Add `expect(result.stdout).toContain("outside the managed root");` to a
 *      pwsh-spawning test. Run this suite -> it must FAIL (member-access form).
 *      Revert.
 *   3. In a consumer test, change `combinedText`'s body from
 *      `return normalizePwshText(`${run.stdout || ""}\n${run.stderr || ""}`);` to
 *      the un-normalized `return `${run.stdout || ""}\n${run.stderr || ""}`;`.
 *      Run this suite -> it must FAIL (renamed-merge-helper form). Revert.
 *   4. Add `expect(result.stdout).toContain(`saw ${n} outside the managed root`);`
 *      to a pwsh-spawning test. Run this suite -> it must FAIL (interpolated-
 *      argument form: after dropping `${n}` the literal text still has a wrappable
 *      word boundary). Revert.
 *   5. Add `const phrase = "outside the managed root";` then
 *      `expect(result.stdout).toContain(phrase);` to a pwsh-spawning test. Run this
 *      suite -> it must FAIL (phrase-variable form). Revert.
 *   6. In a consumer test, change `combinedText`'s body to the string-CONCATENATION
 *      `return run.stdout + "\n" + run.stderr;`. Run this suite -> it must FAIL
 *      (concat renamed-merge-helper form). Revert.
 *   7. In a consumer test, replace the `const combined = combinedText(out);` line
 *      with a MULTI-LINE raw merge that breaks the initializer across real source
 *      newlines:
 *        `const combined =\n  `${out.stdout}\n` +\n  `${out.stderr}`;`.
 *      Run this suite -> it must FAIL (multi-line tainted-local form). Revert.
 *   If a mutation does NOT fail, the guard is inadequate and must be hardened.
 *   Self-tests below feed crafted source strings through the same detector to
 *   prove each form fires (and that its near-miss compliant shape does not
 *   false-positive) without touching real files.
 *
 * Residual limits (the long tail this guard does NOT chase):
 *   The four bypasses listed here historically were CLOSED (each now has a
 *   FLAGGED self-test plus a near-miss COMPLIANT self-test, and a repo-wide
 *   zero-false-positive proof across all pwsh-spawning files). They are kept on the
 *   record so a future reader does not re-add them as "new" gaps:
 *     - INTERPOLATED / TEMPLATE phrase ARGUMENT -- now CLOSED. argumentIsPhrase
 *       strips the `${...}` interpolation segments from a template argument and
 *       treats the remaining literal text as a phrase when it still has a
 *       wrappable interior word boundary, so `expect(out.stdout).toContain(
 *       `prefix ${x} outside the managed root`)` IS flagged on a raw receiver. A
 *       NORMALIZED receiver (`stdoutText(result)`) still passes -- the receiver
 *       classification returns compliant before the argument is consulted.
 *     - PHRASE STORED IN A VARIABLE then asserted -- now CLOSED. collectPhraseVariables
 *       gathers `const|let|var NAME = "<multi-word string literal>"` bindings; an
 *       identifier matcher argument that is such a phrase variable counts as a
 *       phrase, so `const phrase = "outside the managed root"; expect(
 *       out.stdout).toContain(phrase);` IS flagged on a raw receiver. Single-word
 *       string variables and non-string bindings are NOT collected.
 *     - STRING-CONCATENATION raw merge in a renamed helper -- now CLOSED.
 *       isRawMergeExpression treats a top-level `+` concatenation as a raw STRING
 *       merge only when it is GENUINE string concatenation of raw output: it requires
 *       BOTH a raw-output operand (a BARE member `o.stdout` / `(o.stdout || "")`, or a
 *       template literal that interpolates a raw member) AND a string/template-literal
 *       operand. So `=> o.stdout + "\n" + o.stderr` IS flagged, but ARITHMETIC `+`
 *       touching raw output (`a.stdout.length + b.length`, `idx + r.stdout.indexOf(x)`,
 *       `result.stdout.length + 1`) and a string-only `+` with no raw-output operand
 *       (`"x" + y`) are NOT (see B1). A member chain with no top-level `+`
 *       (`return result.stdout.split(...)`), a result-shaper object (`return {
 *       stdout, stderr, status }`), and a wrapped concat (`return
 *       normalizePwshText(a.stdout + b)`) are NOT flagged.
 *     - MULTI-LINE tainted-local initializer -- now CLOSED. collectTaintedRawVariables
 *       reads the FULL initializer expression of EVERY declarator (including the
 *       second-or-later declarator of a comma list, and a PAREN-WRAPPED initializer)
 *       with balanced bracket/paren/template awareness over the offset-preserving MASK
 *       projection (maskCommentsAndStrings), so a raw merge split across REAL source
 *       newlines, wrapped in `(...)`, or hidden after `const x = 1,` still taints the
 *       variable. A multi-line / paren-wrapped NORMALIZED merge is not.
 *
 *   Call-site comment/string safety: the `expect(...)` locator scans the
 *   offset-preserving MASK projection (code kept verbatim, comment AND string/template
 *   payloads blanked), so an `expect(...stdout...).toContain("multi word")` spelled in
 *   a COMMENT or a STRING LITERAL is invisible to the scan; the receiver and argument
 *   text are then read from the RAW source at the offset-aligned positions, so phrase
 *   analysis is exact (see B3). The renamed-merge and collector scans likewise run on
 *   stripped/masked source, so data in comments/strings cannot false-positive.
 *
 *   Remaining intentional residuals (deliberately NOT flagged, to avoid real false
 *   positives; each would need a FLAGGED self-test, a near-miss COMPLIANT self-test,
 *   AND a repo-wide zero-false-positive proof before being closed):
 *     - A helper that returns a BARE single member (`return result.stdout;`): it is
 *       indistinguishable from the legitimate structural single-member reads this repo
 *       relies on (`return result.stdout.split(...)`, `return result.stdout.trim()`,
 *       `return { stdout, stderr, status }`). The member-access detector (violation
 *       (a)) still catches the direct `expect(x.stdout).toContain("...")` call site.
 *     - A `+` concatenation of raw output with NO string/template-literal operand
 *       (e.g. `o.stdout + o.stderr`): without a string operand the expression is
 *       ambiguous with arithmetic, so the B1 rule requires a string operand to flag
 *       it. This repo's only `+` merge spelling includes the `"\n"` separator (which
 *       is flagged); the bare two-member `+` is not used.
 *     - Runtime indirection generally (a phrase or merge assembled through a function
 *       parameter, an array join, etc.). The normalizer's own unit test
 *       (scripts/lib/__tests__/pwsh-output.test.js) is the primary correctness
 *       backstop for the rendered-output normalization itself.
 *
 * @cross-platform-regression -- this marker requires the file to be gated on
 * ubuntu/windows/macos via the targeted step in
 * .github/workflows/cross-platform-preflight.yml; enforced by
 * scripts/__tests__/cross-platform-preflight-coverage.test.js.

## Solution

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                     | Problem                                                | Fix                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using `exclude_mail = true`                 | Deprecated in v0.23.0                                  | Use `include_mail = false`                                    |
| Using `retries = 3`                         | Renamed in v0.23.0                                     | Use `max_retries = 3`                                         |
| Using `verbosity = 1`                       | Changed to string enum in v0.23.0                      | Use `verbose = "info"` (or "error", "warn", "debug", "trace") |
| Skipping validation in CI                   | Config errors surface as cryptic lychee failures       | Add validation step before lychee-action                      |
| Not updating VALID_FIELDS after lychee bump | New valid fields flagged as errors                     | Sync the set with upstream example config                     |
| Pinning to `@v2` without validation         | New lychee versions can break config silently          | Always pair floating tags with config validation              |
| Ignoring TOML table headers in validators   | Invalid table-based config bypasses validation         | Parse `[table]` and `[[array]]` headers as top-level fields   |
| Reading config files at test module scope   | Jest can fail during test collection with poor context | Read files in `beforeAll` with an existence guard             |

Additional parser guard: malformed quoted values such as `"info` or `"info'`
must be treated as invalid and rejected unless opening/closing quotes are present
and use the same quote character.

## Validation Checklist

Before modifying `.lychee.toml`:

- [ ] All field names are in the `VALID_FIELDS` set in `validate-lychee-config.js`
- [ ] No deprecated field names used (check the mapping table above)
- [ ] Boolean fields use `true`/`false`, not integers; `verbose` uses a string enum value
- [ ] Validation script passes: `node scripts/validate-lychee-config.js`
- [ ] Unit tests pass: `npx jest scripts/__tests__/validate-lychee-config.test.js`

After a lychee version upgrade:

- [ ] Compare upstream example config for new/removed/renamed fields
- [ ] Update `VALID_FIELDS` in `validate-lychee-config.js`
- [ ] Update version comment in the script
- [ ] Run validation against existing `.lychee.toml`
- [ ] Update unit tests if field list changed

# Test Organization and Assertions

> **One-line summary**: Use clear naming, structured test classes, and expressive assertions with failure messages.

## Overview

Well-structured tests are easier to review and debug. Names should read like sentences and assertions should explain failures.

## Problem Statement

Poor naming and weak assertions make failures hard to interpret and increase maintenance cost.

## Solution

### Test Class Naming

```csharp
// Pattern: {ClassUnderTest}Tests or {Feature}Tests
public sealed class MessageBusTests { }
public sealed class TargetedMessageDeliveryTests { }
public sealed class RegistrationLifecycleTests { }
```

### Test Method Naming

```csharp
// GOOD: Descriptive, reads naturally
[Test]
public void EmitUntargetedMessageInvokesAllRegisteredHandlers() { }

// BAD: Underscores, unclear
[Test]
public void Test_Emit_Works() { }
```

### Test Class Organization

```csharp
[TestFixture]
public sealed class MessageBusTests
{
    private MessageBus _messageBus;

    [SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        _messageBus = new MessageBus();
    }

    [TearDown]
    public void TearDown()
    {
        _messageBus?.Dispose();
    }

    [Test]
    public void RegisterHandlerSucceeds() { }

    [Test]
    public void RegisterNullHandlerThrows() { }
}
```

### Expressive Assertions

```csharp
Assert.That(
    actualCount,
    Is.EqualTo(expectedCount),
    $"Handler should be invoked {expectedCount} times, but was {actualCount}");

Assert.That(result, Is.Not.Null.And.Not.Empty);
Assert.That(values, Has.Count.EqualTo(5).And.All.GreaterThan(0));
```

### Assert One Concept Per Test

```csharp
[Test]
public void HandlerReceivesCorrectMessagePayload()
{
    TestMessage received = default;
    _messageBus.RegisterUntargetedHandler<TestMessage>(msg => received = msg);

    TestMessage sent = new TestMessage { Value = 42 };
    sent.EmitUntargeted(_messageBus);

    Assert.That(received.Value, Is.EqualTo(42));
}
```

### Use CollectionAssert for Collections

```csharp
CollectionAssert.AreEquivalent(
    new[] { typeof(MessageA), typeof(MessageB), typeof(MessageC) },
    types,
    "Should return all registered message types");
```

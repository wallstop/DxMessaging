# Git and Parser Robustness in CI/CD

## Overview

This skill covers best practices for writing robust git commands in CI/CD pipelines and
implementing reliable markdown parsers that handle edge cases correctly.

## Solution

## Git Command Edge Cases

### Initial Commits and Single-Commit Repositories

Git commands that reference previous commits can fail in specific repository states:

```bash
# DANGEROUS: Fails on initial commit (no HEAD~1 exists)
git diff HEAD~1 -- path/to/file

# DANGEROUS: Fails on single-commit repos
git log --oneline -2  # May return fewer than 2 commits
```

#### Solution patterns

```bash
# Check commit count before referencing ancestors
COMMIT_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
if [ "$COMMIT_COUNT" -gt 1 ]; then
    git diff HEAD~1 -- path/to/file
else
    echo "No previous commit to compare against"
fi
```

```bash
# Use --first-parent and handle errors gracefully
git diff HEAD~1 -- path/to/file 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Shallow Clones in CI Environments

Many CI systems use shallow clones for speed. Commands that traverse history may fail:

```bash
# DANGEROUS: May fail with shallow clone
git log --oneline --all

# DANGEROUS: Ancestor references may not exist
git merge-base main feature-branch
```

#### Solution patterns

```bash
# Fetch sufficient depth before operations
git fetch --depth=50 origin main

# Or unshallow if needed
git fetch --unshallow 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Detached HEAD States

CI systems often check out specific commits, creating detached HEAD states:

```bash
# DANGEROUS: Branch name queries fail in detached HEAD
git branch --show-current  # Returns empty string

# DANGEROUS: Assumes branch context
git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/$(git branch --show-current)
```

#### Solution patterns

```bash
# Check for detached HEAD before branch operations
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ -z "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]; then
    echo "In detached HEAD state, using SHA instead"
    CURRENT_REF=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
else
    CURRENT_REF=$CURRENT_BRANCH
fi
```

### Empty Repository States

Scripts must handle repositories with no commits:

```bash
# DANGEROUS: Fails on empty repos
git log --oneline -1

# DANGEROUS: HEAD doesn't exist
git rev-parse HEAD
```

#### Solution patterns

```bash
# Check if HEAD exists before using it
if git rev-parse HEAD >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    git log --oneline -1
else
    echo "Repository has no commits"
fi
```

### File Path Edge Cases

Git commands with file paths can fail unexpectedly:

```bash
# DANGEROUS: Fails if path contains spaces
git diff HEAD -- $FILE_PATH

# DANGEROUS: Glob patterns may match nothing
git diff HEAD -- *.md
```

#### Solution patterns

```bash
# Always quote variables containing paths
git diff HEAD -- "$FILE_PATH"

# Use nullglob or check pattern expansion
shopt -s nullglob
FILES=(*.md)
if [ ${#FILES[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
    git diff HEAD -- "${FILES[@]}"
fi
```

### Line Ending Normalization: Index vs Working Tree

`git add --renormalize` is commonly misunderstood. It updates the git **index** (staging area) based on `.gitattributes` rules but does **not** modify working tree files:

```bash
# MISLEADING: This does NOT fix files on disk
git add --renormalize -- '*.md' '**/*.md'
# After this command:
# - Index: updated with normalized content
# - Working tree: UNCHANGED (still has original line endings)
# - Repository: left in a staged state
```

#### When to use each approach

| Goal                                         | Command                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Fix files on disk after cloning              | `node scripts/fix-eol.js`         |
| Re-stage files after `.gitattributes` change | `git add --renormalize`           |
| Fix files copied from external source        | `node scripts/fix-eol.js`         |
| Verify line endings without changing         | `node scripts/check-eol.js`       |
| Verify line endings before committing        | `node scripts/check-eol.js --all` |

#### Working tree fix pattern

```bash
# Recommended: Fix working tree directly
node scripts/fix-eol.js

# Optional: Verbose mode shows what was fixed
node scripts/fix-eol.js -v
```

## Overview

Continuation material extracted from `test-production-code.md` to keep .llm files within the 300-line budget.

## Solution

## SYNC Note Best Practices

When duplication is unavoidable, follow these SYNC note guidelines:

1. **Always bidirectional**: Both files must reference each other
1. **Never use line numbers**: Reference function names, not line numbers that change
1. **Use descriptive identifiers**: `SYNC: Keep in sync with validate.js isValidEmail()` not `SYNC: Keep in sync with validate.js line 42`
1. **Verify references exist**: Confirm the referenced function exists before adding the note
1. **Update both on changes**: When modifying synced code, update both locations

## Red Flags to Watch For

These patterns suggest tests may not be exercising production code:

| Red Flag                                               | Why It's Suspicious           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Test file defines validation constants                 | Should import from production |
| Test file has utility functions that mirror production | Should import instead         |
| Test never imports the module it's supposedly testing  | Tests itself, not production  |
| Test file size rivals production file size             | Too much duplicated logic     |
| Same bug exists in production and tests                | Copied code with copied bugs  |

## Verification Checklist

Before merging, verify tests exercise production code:

1. **Check imports**: Does the test file import from the production module?
1. **Check coverage**: Does production file show coverage when tests run?
1. **Mutation test**: Change production code slightly - do tests fail?
1. **Review test functions**: Are they calling production code or local copies?
1. **Search for duplication**: Do test and production files have similar function bodies?

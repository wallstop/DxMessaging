# Object Pooling for Zero-Allocation Messaging

> **One-line summary**: Eliminate garbage collection spikes by reusing message objects instead of allocating new ones for each message emit.

## Overview

Object pooling is a creational pattern that pre-allocates and reuses objects instead of creating new instances each time they're needed. In messaging systems, this is critical because:

1. **High frequency**: Message systems often emit thousands of messages per frame
1. **Short-lived objects**: Messages are typically consumed immediately and discarded
1. **GC pressure**: Frequent allocations of short-lived objects trigger garbage collection
1. **Frame spikes**: GC pauses cause visible stuttering in games

By pooling message objects, we achieve near-zero allocation messaging even under heavy load.

## Problem Statement

Consider a typical messaging system that allocates a new message for each emit:

```csharp
public void EmitDamageEvent(int damage, GameObject source)
{
    // Allocates ~40 bytes per call
    DamageMessage message = new DamageMessage(damage, source);
    messageBus.Emit(message);
    // message becomes garbage immediately after handlers complete
}
```

In a game with 100 entities each emitting 10 messages per second, that's 1,000 allocations/second. Over 60 seconds, you've created 60,000 garbage objects, triggering multiple GC collections.

**Symptoms**:

- Frame rate drops every few seconds (GC spikes)
- Increasing memory usage followed by sudden drops
- Profiler shows high allocation rate in messaging code
- `GC.Collect` appearing in profiler hot path

## Solution

Refer to the detailed implementation guides linked below, which cover:

- implementation strategy and data structures
- code examples with patterns and variations
- usage examples and testing considerations
- performance notes and anti-patterns

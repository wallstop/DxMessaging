## Overview

Continuation extracted from `serializable-dictionary.md` to keep files within the repository line-budget policy.

## Solution

## Best Practices

### Do

- Use for configuration data edited in Inspector
- Use with ScriptableObjects for shared config
- Keep dictionaries reasonably sized (<1000 entries for editor performance)
- Use meaningful key types (enums, strings)

### Don't

- Don't use for runtime-generated data (no serialization benefit)
- Don't use for very large datasets (serialization overhead)
- Don't duplicate keys in Inspector (later one wins)
- Don't store UnityEngine.Object references that might become null

### Handling Duplicates

```csharp
public void OnAfterDeserialize()
{
    dictionary.Clear();

    HashSet<TKey> seen = new HashSet<TKey>();
    for (int i = 0; i < keys.Count; i++)
    {
        TKey key = keys[i];
        if (key != null && seen.Add(key)) // Skip duplicates
        {
            dictionary[key] = values[i];
        }
        else if (key != null)
        {
            Debug.LogWarning($"Duplicate key ignored: {key}");
        }
    }
}
```

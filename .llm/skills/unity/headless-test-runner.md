# Headless Unity Test Runner

> **One-line summary**: `bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform <editmode|playmode|standalone>` is the canonical command to run Unity tests inside the devcontainer; it spawns an ephemeral `unityci/editor` container via the host docker socket and streams the log to stdout.

## When to Use

- Iterating on Runtime/Editor code that has Unity tests under `Tests/Editor` or `Tests/Runtime`.
- Reproducing a Unity workflow failure from `unity-tests.yml` (editmode/playmode/standalone) locally.
- Smoke-testing a change to `scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js` or the test harness.
- Verifying the perf-isolation contract by running with and without `--include-perf`.

## When NOT to Use

- Source-generator tests under `SourceGenerators/`. Use `dotnet test` directly; those tests run on the .NET SDK and do not need Unity.
- Standalone analyzer unit tests. Same: `dotnet test SourceGenerators/...Tests`.
- Pure documentation or markdown changes; no Unity surface to exercise.
- Apple Silicon (ARM Mac) hosts. See the limitation section below.

## Command Reference

| Flag                     | Type       | Default                             | When to Set                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--platform`             | enum (req) | none                                | `editmode`, `playmode`, or `standalone`. Required.                                              |
| `--unity-version`        | string     | `2022.3.45f1` (or `$UNITY_VERSION`) | Pin a different Editor version when reproducing a matrix-specific failure.                      |
| `--filter`               | regex      | empty                               | Forward to Unity's `-testFilter`. Use to narrow to a single fixture or namespace.               |
| `--include-perf`         | bool flag  | off                                 | Include `Benchmarks` / `Allocations` asmdefs. Default local runs keep these excluded.           |
| `--include-integrations` | bool flag  | off                                 | Include `VContainer` / `Zenject` / `Reflex` suites. Requires those packages in `manifest.json`. |
| `--include-comparisons`  | bool flag  | off                                 | Include external comparison benchmarks. Requires MessagePipe / UniRx / UniTask / Zenject.       |
| `--results`              | path       | `.artifacts/unity/results.xml`      | Override NUnit XML output path. Must live under the repo (bind-mount limit).                    |
| `--help`                 | flag       | -                                   | Print usage and exit 0.                                                                         |

The defaults match `defaultIncludeAssemblies(repoRoot)` from `scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js`. That module is the single source of truth and is also resolved by the active Unity workflows via the `.github/actions/compute-unity-assemblies` composite action.

## Expected Runtimes

Numbers below assume the mode-specific `dxm-unity-library-<image-tag>-<mode>` volume is warm. First-ever run on a fresh image pulls roughly 6 GB into the `unityci/editor:<tag>` layer cache; that pull is one-time per Unity version.

| Mode         | Cold (first pull) | Warm Library cache | Notes                                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `editmode`   | ~6-10 min         | ~30-90 s           | Cheapest. Runs in the Editor's edit-time NUnit harness.                      |
| `playmode`   | ~7-12 min         | ~2-5 min           | Spins up a play-mode test runner; longer domain reload.                      |
| `standalone` | ~15-25 min        | ~10+ min           | Native single pass builds and runs the IL2CPP player; AOT compile dominates. |

If a warm run takes more than 2x the expected time, the Library cache is likely cold or a domain reload is looping. Inspect `.artifacts/unity/log.txt`.

## Realtime Feedback

- `-logFile -` streams Unity's log to stdout while the container is alive. The script also `tee`s the same stream into `.artifacts/unity/log.txt`.
- NUnit XML lands at `.artifacts/unity/results.xml` (or `--results` override). The script invokes `python3 scripts/unity/lib/parse-test-results.py` on that XML and prints a one-line `PASS` or `FAIL` summary; the script's exit code matches the test status.
- IL2CPP standalone runs natively in a single pass locally (`Unity -runTests -testPlatform StandaloneLinux64`), so it writes one `.artifacts/unity/log.txt` like editmode/playmode -- there is no separate build-log.txt. The local harness uses the local project settings, whereas CI generates a temporary Windows project and configures `StandaloneWindows64` IL2CPP in `scripts/unity/run-ci-tests.ps1`: both exercise the IL2CPP AOT toolchain but on different host OS, so local does NOT reproduce the CI standalone run byte-for-byte. Validate the headless standalone run on first use.

## License Setup

The runner refuses to launch without a supported Unity license path. Local runs prefer a paid serial and fall back to a `.ulf`: `run-tests.sh` / `run-tests.ps1` use `UNITY_SERIAL` + `UNITY_EMAIL` + `UNITY_PASSWORD` (classic `-serial` activation, with the seat returned on exit) when all three are set, and fall back to the local ULF path (`UNITY_LICENSE_B64` / `UNITY_LICENSE_FILE` / raw `UNITY_LICENSE`) otherwise (for example, a Personal license in a cloud Codespace). The exact bootstrap flow lives in [unity-license-bootstrap](./unity-license-bootstrap.md):

1. For a paid serial, set `UNITY_SERIAL`, `UNITY_EMAIL`, and `UNITY_PASSWORD`.
1. For the ULF fallback, run `bash scripts/unity/activate-license.sh --apply <path-to.ulf>` and add the printed `UNITY_LICENSE_B64` export.
1. Run `bash scripts/unity/activate-license.sh --check` before the first test run.

The devcontainer forwards `UNITY_SERIAL`, `UNITY_EMAIL`, `UNITY_PASSWORD`, `UNITY_LICENSE`, `UNITY_LICENSE_B64`, and `LOCAL_WORKSPACE_FOLDER` from the host via `remoteEnv` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Inside a devcontainer the local runner still prefers `docker inspect` of the current container mount over `LOCAL_WORKSPACE_FOLDER`; this avoids passing Windows drive-letter paths to a Linux Docker CLI.

In CI the serial is activated and returned per run; see [unity-license-return-guarantee](./unity-license-return-guarantee.md) for the four-layer always-return guarantee.

## Iteration Patterns

Run a single fixture by class name:

```bash
bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform editmode --filter 'MessageBusBasicTests'
```

Reproduce a regression on the oldest supported LTS:

```bash
bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform playmode --unity-version 2021.3.45f1
```

Run the perf suite locally (no CI parity; use sparingly):

```bash
bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform editmode --include-perf
```

Run external comparison benchmarks after adding their packages to the harness manifest:

```bash
bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform editmode --include-comparisons
```

Build and run the IL2CPP test player end-to-end:

```bash
bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform standalone
```

Diff the discovered assembly list before changing the runner default:

```bash
node scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js
```

| `ERROR: 0 tests ran. Check filter / assembly list.`                 | `--filter` matched nothing or the asmdef list excluded all. | Re-run without `--filter`; verify discovery via `node scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js`.         |

| `Cannot determine host path for the workspace.`                     | Inside a container without an inspectable bind mount.       | Set `DXM_HOST_REPO_ROOT=/absolute/path/on/host` before invoking the script.                           |
| `Activation rate limit` in Unity log                                | Too many license activations in a short window.             | Wait ~1 hour. See [unity-license-bootstrap](./unity-license-bootstrap.md) for the cooldown details.   |

## ARM Mac (Apple Silicon) Limitation

`unityci/editor` images are amd64-only as of 2026-05. Running them via `docker run` on Apple Silicon falls back to QEMU emulation, which is roughly 10x slower and frequently hangs the editor during domain reload. There are two sanctioned paths on M-series Macs:

1. Skip local Unity runs and rely on CI: the active GitHub Unity workflows run direct Unity on self-hosted Windows runners, so an ARM Mac can push and let CI exercise Unity.
1. Open the repo in a hosted GitHub Codespace (`gh codespace create`). The Codespace runs on amd64 hardware and the in-container Unity flow works the same as on Linux/Windows hosts.

`.llm/context.md` carries a single-line warning so an agent flags this proactively when `uname -m` returns `arm64`.

## CI vs Local

CI calls `scripts/unity/run-ci-tests.ps1`, not the local Docker runner. The active Unity workflows run Unity directly on self-hosted Windows runners. `unity-tests.yml` is one matrix of editmode/playmode/standalone; `standalone` maps to `StandaloneWindows64` and configures IL2CPP in the generated `.artifacts/unity/projects/<version>-<mode>/` project. Each workflow adds the shared `verify-unity-results` step that parses the NUnit XML with native PowerShell `[xml]` and FAILS when zero tests ran or no XML exists. The single source of truth for the assembly include list is still `scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js` (`defaultIncludeAssemblies`), invoked from a `Compute test assembly list` step.

The `run-tests.sh` / `run-tests.ps1` scripts are the canonical LOCAL reproduction path (devcontainer / local docker / local Windows Unity). For `standalone` the local devcontainer driver builds a `StandaloneLinux64` IL2CPP player while CI builds `StandaloneWindows64`; both exercise the IL2CPP AOT toolchain but on different host OS, so local approximates -- it does not byte-for-byte reproduce -- the CI standalone player. Validate the headless standalone run on first use. They still validate `results.xml` via `parse-test-results.py`, FAIL the run if zero tests ran (`total=0`), and -- when `CI=true` is set -- emit GitHub Actions `::error::` annotations on failure (and a `::notice::` on pass). `CI` only adds annotations; it never skips work or changes control flow. The shape is locked by a contract test (`unity-runner-script-contract.test.js`) so help text, flag names, the assembly source-of-truth, and the never-report-success-without-results invariant cannot drift apart.

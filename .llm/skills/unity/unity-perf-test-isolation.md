# Unity Perf Test Isolation

> **One-line summary**: Asmdefs whose name matches `Benchmarks|Allocations` are classified as `perf`; `Comparisons` assemblies are a separate external-package opt-in. Both are excluded from default local Unity runs by `scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js`.

## When to Use

- Adding a new benchmark, allocation-counting, or library-comparison test suite.
- Investigating why a perf-looking asmdef does or does not run on a PR.
- Debugging a "0 tests ran" CI failure when the suite name pattern is suspect.
- Verifying the default Unity run still excludes perf after a refactor.

## When NOT to Use

- Adding a regular correctness test. Those are `core` and run by default; no isolation work is needed.
- Adding a DI integration suite (VContainer / Zenject / Reflex). Those have their own classification (`integration`) and opt-in flag.

## The Rule

Source-of-truth is `.llm/context.md` line 114:

> Benchmark and performance/allocation tests must stay isolated from the standard test suite.

Operationally, this is enforced by classification in `scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js`:

```js
const PERF_NAME_REGEX = /(?:Benchmarks|Allocations)/;
const COMPARISON_NAME_REGEX = /(?:Comparisons)/;
```

Any asmdef under `Tests/` whose `name` field contains `Benchmarks` or `Allocations` is classified as `perf`; `Comparisons` is classified as `comparison` because those suites depend on external comparison packages that are not in the default harness manifest. The generated CI manifest in `scripts/unity/run-ci-tests.ps1` includes `com.unity.test-framework.performance`, because benchmark and allocation asmdefs reference `Unity.PerformanceTesting`. Three things have to be true for the isolation to hold:

1. Perf assemblies live under `Tests/Editor/Benchmarks`, `Tests/Editor/Allocations`, `Tests/Editor/Comparisons`, or `Tests/Runtime/Benchmarks`.
1. Their asmdef `name` field contains `Benchmarks`, `Allocations`, or `Comparisons` so classification matches.
1. They are NOT mentioned by name in any workflow's `customParameters`. The workflow reads its assembly list from `defaultIncludeAssemblies()`, never from a hand-edited list.

## How Exclusion Works

`scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js` exports `defaultIncludeAssemblies(repoRoot, options)`. The behaviour:

| Asmdef Class  | Default Include? | Opt-in Flag                                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core`        | Yes              | (always on)                                                 |
| `perf`        | No               | `{ includePerf: true }` or `--include-perf`                 |
| `comparison`  | No               | `{ includeComparisons: true }` or `--include-comparisons`   |
| `integration` | No               | `{ includeIntegrations: true }` or `--include-integrations` |

Three callers consume this module:

- `scripts/unity/run-tests.sh` builds its assembly list at startup and passes it to Unity via `-assemblyNames`.
- `scripts/unity/run-tests.ps1` does the same on Windows.
- The active workflows under `.github/workflows/unity-*.yml` resolve the list through the `.github/actions/compute-unity-assemblies` composite action, which calls the same asmdef-discovery module -- no hand-maintained lists.
- The active `unity-benchmarks.yml` passes `include-perf: "true"` to that composite (which calls `defaultIncludeAssemblies(process.cwd(), { includePerf: true })`) and skips integrations plus external comparisons. The `.github/workflows-disabled/*` files are the ubuntu reference mirrors of the active self-hosted Windows workflows.

Because every caller goes through the same module, adding a new perf asmdef requires no edits to the workflows or runner scripts.

## Adding a New Perf Asmdef

1. Place the asmdef under `Tests/Editor/Benchmarks/`, `Tests/Editor/Allocations/`, or `Tests/Runtime/Benchmarks/`.
1. Set its `name` field to include one of the magic substrings. Examples that match:
   - `WallstopStudios.DxMessaging.Tests.Editor.Benchmarks.Dispatch`
   - `WallstopStudios.DxMessaging.Tests.Runtime.Allocations.Pooling`
1. Verify classification:

   ```bash
   node scripts/unity/lib/asmdef-discovery.js
   ```

   The output groups asmdefs by category. Confirm the new entry shows `[perf]`.

1. Confirm the default run excludes it:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform editmode
   ```

   The runner echoes the resolved assembly list at startup; the new asmdef should NOT appear.

1. Confirm the benchmark workflow includes it:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform editmode --include-perf
   ```

   The new asmdef should now appear in the resolved list.

If the asmdef ends up in the `core` bucket instead, the most common cause is the `name` field missing the magic substring. Rename the asmdef (and its file) so the substring is present.

## Where Perf Actually Runs

| Workflow               | Triggers                        | Includes Perf? |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `unity-tests.yml`      | PR / push / schedule / dispatch | NO             |
| `unity-benchmarks.yml` | schedule / dispatch             | YES            |

The active `.github/workflows/unity-*.yml` workflows run Unity directly on
self-hosted Windows runners through `scripts/unity/run-ci-tests.ps1` (benchmarks
included). The `.github/workflows-disabled/*` files are the ubuntu reference
mirrors kept for parity, not the live templates. Note: IL2CPP is now the
`standalone` entry in the `unity-tests.yml` `test-mode` matrix; the direct runner
maps it to `StandaloneWindows64` and configures IL2CPP in the generated project.
Verify the active workflows still exist any time you edit them:

```bash
test -e .github/workflows/unity-tests.yml
test -e .github/workflows/unity-benchmarks.yml
```

## Comparison Suites

Comparison asmdefs live under `Tests/Editor/Comparisons/` and benchmark against external libraries such as MessagePipe, UniRx, UniTask, and Zenject. They are excluded from `--include-perf` because the default generated manifest does not install those packages. To run them locally, add the external packages to the generated manifest or a local harness manifest and pass:

```bash
bash scripts/unity/run-tests.sh --platform editmode --include-comparisons
```

The runner should print `comparisons=true` and include the comparison asmdef in the resolved assembly list. Unity will only compile that asmdef when the external comparison packages are installed, because its package-driven define constraints guard the whole assembly.

## Phase 4 Contract Test

`scripts/__tests__/unity-perf-isolation.test.js` (Phase 4B) enumerates every asmdef under `Tests/` and asserts:

- Every asmdef matching the perf regex is classified as `perf`.
- Every asmdef NOT matching the perf or integration regex is classified as `core` and appears in `defaultIncludeAssemblies(repo)`.
- The disabled `unity-tests.yml` template resolves its assembly list via `defaultIncludeAssemblies` rather than hand-rolled YAML.
- Disabled `unity-benchmarks.yml` template opts into perf via `{ includePerf: true }`.

The test catches the silent regression "I added a new perf asmdef and forgot to update the exclusion list" because the exclusion list is computed, not hand-maintained.

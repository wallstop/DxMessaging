# Changelog Management

> **One-line summary**: Maintain a human-readable, chronologically organized record of notable changes following the Keep a Changelog format.

## Overview

A changelog is a curated, chronological record of user-facing changes for each release. It helps users understand what changed, whether a version is safe to adopt, and how to plan upgrades without digging through commits.

In a Unity messaging library context, the changelog is the primary source of truth for:

- New features that users can adopt
- Breaking changes to watch for
- Fixes that resolve user-visible bugs
- Performance changes that affect runtime behavior

## Problem Statement

Without a well-maintained changelog:

- Users cannot tell what changed between versions
- Breaking changes surprise users after upgrading
- Support burden increases as users ask "what's new?"
- Historical context for decisions is lost

## Solution

### Core Concept: Keep a Changelog Format

Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) specification. Every release section uses these categories:

| Category       | Description                       | Example                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Added**      | New features                      | New message type, new API method           |
| **Changed**    | Changes to existing functionality | Modified method signature, behavior change |
| **Deprecated** | Features to be removed in future  | Old API marked for removal                 |
| **Removed**    | Features removed in this release  | Deleted obsolete classes                   |
| **Fixed**      | Bug fixes                         | Corrected message routing issue            |
| **Security**   | Vulnerability patches             | Fixed message validation exploit           |

### File Structure

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New feature being developed

## [2.1.4] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- Resolved issue with targeted message delivery when target is destroyed

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/wallstop-studios/com.wallstop-studios.dxmessaging/compare/v2.1.4...HEAD
```

### When to Update the Changelog

Update the changelog for **every user-facing change**:

| Change Type                          | Update Changelog? | Category                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| New public API                       | Yes               | Added                      |
| Bug fix                              | Yes               | Fixed                      |
| Performance improvement              | Yes               | Changed                    |
| Internal refactoring (no API change) | No                | N/A                        |
| Test additions                       | No                | N/A                        |
| Documentation fixes                  | Maybe             | Changed (if significant)   |
| Dependency updates                   | Maybe             | Changed (if affects users) |
| Breaking changes                     | Yes               | Changed/Removed            |

### Semantic Versioning Guidelines

Given version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  |     |     \\-- Patch: Bug fixes, no API changes
  |     \\-------- Minor: New features, backward compatible
  \\-------------- Major: Breaking changes
```

- **Bump MAJOR** when removing public API or changing behavior incompatibly
- **Bump MINOR** when adding backward-compatible features or deprecating APIs
- **Bump PATCH** when fixing bugs or making compatible performance improvements

### Entry Quality Rules

- Describe user impact, not implementation details
- Start entries with a clear verb (Add, Fix, Change, Remove)
- Link issues or PRs when available
- Flag breaking changes explicitly with migration guidance

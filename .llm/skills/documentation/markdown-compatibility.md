# Markdown Compatibility Guidelines

> **One-line summary**: Use only standard markdown syntax that renders correctly in GitHub, VS Code, and MkDocs simultaneously.

## Overview

This project's documentation must render correctly across multiple platforms:

- **GitHub's markdown viewer** (README, docs in repo)
- **VS Code markdown preview** (local development)
- **Standard markdown renderers** (third-party tools, npm packages)
- **MkDocs** (docs site build)

Using MkDocs-specific syntax breaks rendering in standard viewers, creating a poor experience for users who browse documentation on GitHub or in their editor.

## Problem Statement

MkDocs and its Material theme provide powerful extensions like admonitions, tabs, and buttons. However, these extensions use non-standard syntax that renders as broken text in standard markdown viewers:

```markdown
!!! warning "Caution"
This will not render correctly on GitHub.
```

On GitHub, this displays as literal text: `!!! warning "Caution"` followed by an indented paragraph—not as a styled warning box.

## Solution

Use only standard markdown syntax with Unicode emoji for visual emphasis. This ensures consistent rendering across all platforms.

## Nested Fenced Code Blocks

When documenting markdown that contains code blocks, the **outer fence must have MORE backticks than any inner fence**. CommonMark requires opening and closing sequences to match exactly, so use 4+ backticks for outer fences when inner uses 3:

`````markdown
````markdown
This outer fence uses 4 backticks.

```python
print("Hello")
```
````
`````

For deeper nesting, keep increasing: outer uses 5, middle uses 4, inner uses 3.

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake             | Problem                              | Fix                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Same backtick count | Inner fence closes outer prematurely | More backticks on outer        |
| Spaces in fence     | ` ``` ` may not parse                | No spaces in backtick sequence |
| Mismatched closing  | Opening with 4, closing with 3       | Count must match exactly       |

# Skill File Sizing Guidelines

> **One-line summary**: Keep skill files between 200-350 lines for optimal LLM context usage and maintainability.

## Overview

Skill files are designed to provide focused, actionable guidance that LLMs can effectively use during code generation and problem-solving. File size directly impacts how well an LLM can understand and apply the skill content. Files that are too long overwhelm context windows and dilute focus; files that are too short lack sufficient detail for proper application.

This skill documents the sizing requirements for skill files and context documents in the `.llm/` directory.

## Problem Statement

Large skill files create several problems:

- **Context window saturation**: LLMs have limited context windows; overly large files consume disproportionate space
- **Reduced focus**: Long files often cover too many concepts, making it harder for LLMs to identify relevant guidance
- **Maintenance burden**: Large files are harder to review, update, and keep accurate
- **Cognitive overload**: Both humans and LLMs struggle with monolithic documentation

Conversely, files that are too short may lack:

- Sufficient examples to demonstrate patterns
- Edge case coverage
- Anti-pattern documentation

## Solution

### Core Concept

Apply strict line count limits with graduated enforcement:

| Range         | Status     | Action                                     |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| < 200 lines   | 📝 Short   | Consider adding more examples or detail    |
| 200-350 lines | ✅ Ideal   | Target range for skill files               |
| 351-500 lines | ⚠️ Warning | Consider splitting into focused sub-skills |
| > 500 lines   | ❌ Error   | Must split; blocks CI/pre-commit           |

### Implementation

Line count validation is automated via `scripts/validate-skills.js`:

```javascript
const LINE_LIMIT_IDEAL_MIN = 200;
const LINE_LIMIT_IDEAL_MAX = 350;
const LINE_LIMIT_HARD_MAX = 500;
```

Run validation manually:

```bash
node scripts/validate-skills.js
```

### Enforcement Points

1. **Pre-commit hook**: Warns on files exceeding 350 lines, blocks on 500+
1. **CI/CD pipeline**: Fails PRs that introduce files exceeding 500 lines
1. **Index generation**: Reports line counts in `index.md`

## Variations

### Variation A: Context Files

The main `context.md` file follows the same limits. If it grows too large, extract detailed guidance into category-specific skill files.

> **Note**: `context.md` is excluded from "short file" informational messages since it serves as a high-level summary document that intentionally references other skill files rather than containing exhaustive detail itself.

### Variation B: Specification Files

`specification.md` and `index.md` are exempt from validation but should still aim for reasonable lengths.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Splitting a Large Skill

If `object-pooling.md` exceeds 350 lines:

**Before** (one large file):

```text
.llm/skills/performance/
└── object-pooling.md (450 lines)
```

**After** (split by variation):

```text
.llm/skills/performance/
├── object-pooling.md (180 lines - core concept)
├── array-pooling.md (200 lines - array-specific)
├── collection-pooling.md (220 lines - collections)
└── stringbuilder-pooling.md (190 lines - StringBuilder)
```

### Example 2: Organizing Related Skills

Group related skills under a common category with cross-references:

```markdown
## See Also

- [Array Pooling](./array-pooling.md) - Specialized pooling for arrays
- [Collection Pooling](./collection-pooling.md) - List and Dictionary pooling
```

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Kitchen Sink Skills

```markdown
# Everything About Performance

This skill covers pooling, caching, inlining, struct optimization,
memory alignment, SIMD, async patterns, threading...
```

**Why it's wrong**: Covers too many unrelated concepts. Split into focused skills.

### ❌ Overly Terse Skills

```markdown
# Object Pooling

Use pools. Here's how:

`ObjectPool<T>.Get()` / `ObjectPool<T>.Return()`

Done.
```

**Why it's wrong**: Lacks examples, context, anti-patterns, and edge cases.

### ❌ Excessive Code Duplication

Including the same example code in multiple variations within one file. Extract to a referenced utility or create separate skill files.

## Testing Considerations

Validation is automated:

```bash
# Run validation
node scripts/validate-skills.js

# Check output for size warnings/errors
# ⚠️  size: File has 380 lines (ideal: 200-350)
# ❌ size: File has 520 lines (max: 500)
```

## When to Split a Skill

Consider splitting when:

1. **Line count exceeds 350**: The primary trigger
1. **Multiple distinct variations**: Each variation could stand alone
1. **Different complexity levels**: Basic vs. advanced usage
1. **Different use cases**: Unity-specific vs. general .NET
1. **Tangential content**: Testing guidance, migration guides

## File Organization Strategy

```text
.llm/skills/{category}/
├── {main-concept}.md           # Core pattern (200-350 lines)
├── {concept}-{variation1}.md   # Specific variation
├── {concept}-{variation2}.md   # Another variation
└── {concept}-advanced.md       # Advanced usage
```

Cross-reference using the `related` frontmatter field and `## See Also` sections.

## Performance Notes

File size limits improve:

- **LLM response quality**: Focused context leads to better suggestions
- **Index generation speed**: Smaller files parse faster
- **PR review efficiency**: Reviewers can assess changes quickly
